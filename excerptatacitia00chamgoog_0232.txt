lakes between the Rhine and the Ems, while Caecina and Pedo had
conducted their forces (four legions and the cavalry) to the same
place by other routes (see sec. 60). And now they were to return in
the same way3 but two of the legions of Germanicus returned part
of the way by land (see 70).—angustus is tramesl. This was
the pontes lonyos, a sort of corduroy road made of timber and gravei
by Lucius Domitius, grandfather of the emperor Nero (see 4:44).

humentia ultral, “ beyond the wet ground.” The preposition here,
as frequently in TacituS, is placed by anastrophe (Intr. 116, α) after
its noun, in imitation of the poets (see 19). Caecina had arranged
his forces, so as to keep the enemy from rushing upon him from the
contiguous forests (64) ; but the legions assigned to the flanks now
desert their post, leaving the line open to the attack (libero incursu)
of Arminius, which he breaks through (scindit), and produces great
confusion and destruction, especially among the cavalry. This
