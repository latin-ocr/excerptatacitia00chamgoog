38. Porto an dolo principisl. Nero was a man of trifling‚ reck·
less character, utterly unfit sor his position as emperor, leading a
dissolute and disreputable life among actors‚ musicians, and the
abandoned classes ς and hence liable to the suspicion of having
burned the city in his shameless folly and madness. Rome had been
wholly burned by the Gauls (Senones, 41), three hundred and sixty-
five years aster it was founded (3.0. 389), and portions of it in 780
and 789 ;' Am. 27 and 36 (see 4: 643 6: 45). The present burning,
however, though only about two-thirds of the city were destroyed,
was a much greater calamity (clades) than had yet befallen it, on
account of the great extent to which the city had now attained; it
being about thirteen miles in circuit, and containing probably a mil·
lion and a half of inhabitants, and a very large number of costly
public buildingS‚ with works of art and other forms of wealth innu-
merable. —circi], i.e. the Circus Maximus, in the south-western part
of the city, situated in the level space between the Palatine Hill on

city by the Gauls, it was rebuilt in great haste, and without much
regard to order3 so that, as Livy says (4: 55), it had the appearance

The reading is doubtful here; but the reference evidently is to the
aged and· to children. The description which follows of the be-
wilderment and confusion which attended the conflagration is very
vivid and natural. -‚‚- diurni quoque victus]‚ ‘⁸ with the loss also of

vious clause-esse sibi . . . jussul, “bawled out that they had
authority, whether that they might plunder more freely or by com-
mand.'’ Sive . . . sive leave it wholly undecided which hypothesis
should be assumed as true. In large fires, desperate characters al·
ways make their appearance, further to trouble the scene.
