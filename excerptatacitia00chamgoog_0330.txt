— In this edition much labor has been bestowed upon the introductory
matter, which constitutes a distinctive feature of the book. It contains an
Essay upon the Origin, History, and Transmission of the Homeric Poems,
giving in the form of a connected narrative full explanation in regard to the
Homeric question; an Essay on Scanning‚ which presents the subject in a
simple, untechnical way, and illustrates the Homeric verse by the aid of
English hexameters3 and a concise yet complete Sketch of the Homeric
Dialect. The Notes have been made quite full, and aim to supply that eol-
lateral information so much needed in the study of Homer. References
are made to the Greek Grammars of Hadley (Allen's new edition) and
Goodwin.

A very attractive feature of the book is a perfect fac—simile of a page
of the famous Venetian Manuscript of the Iliad,—the best manuscript of
Homer and one ot the finest of all existing manuscripts.

No paine have been spared to make this the best-equipped
and the most useful edition of the Iliad which can be put into

the hands of a pupil, and it is almost universally accepted, not
only as the best school-edition in the English language of any

part of Homer, but also ae a text-book of altogether exceptional
merit.

Professor J. H. wmmm Dartmouth Colleye. -1t possesses many features
that place it far beyond all its competitors.

W. C. Comum, Head-Master Roaebury Latin ›Sc-hoel, Boston. —It is certainly
one of the most beautiful, as well as one of the most useful, of school-books; in

fact, 1 don’t know what could be better suited to the needs of a student beginning
Greek.

Professor B. L. Cmmzr, Phillips Exeter Academy, Emeter, N. II. -When my

next class take the Iliad I shall certainly use your new edition. It is just the
thing for them.

qualified approbation of a text-book sor schools3 but Mr. Robert P. Keep’s edition
