(H. 2: 13) 3 vile damnum, etc. (Ann. 2: 85). And often.

ἓ 121. The brevity of expression, springing from his vivid and ener-
getic conception of things, and without a parallel in all ancient litera-
ture, is attained by means of Ellipses, Participial and Covrdinate
constructions, the Asyndeton, the disregard of Concinnity‚ and the dis-
dain of rhetorical Fulness.—Instances of Ellipsis are found in the
frequent omission of small words, the prepositions and conjunctions,
the forms of esse and of verba dicendi et movendi (ἓξ 20, 21).

No writer so abounds in what is called the preynant construction, by
which more is implied than is actually expressed: as, jus legationis
(sc. violatum) miseratur (Anu. 1: 39); pericula (= societatem peri·
culorum) polliceri (22 4o); reipublicae injurias (222. veniam injuri-
arum) ne largiretur (3: 70); exemit etiam Drusum dicendae primo
loco sententiae (necessitati), 3: 22; proruunt fossas (= terra proruta
explent), 1: 68; plerumque permoveor (sc. ad opinionem) num (42
57) 3 Nero non prius differi potuit (= adduci ut differet), 13: 2ος
exitium irritare (= iram ad exitium), 13: 13 14: 3.

Not less a favorite with him is the zeuqma, by which the meaning
of a word is strained to make it do double service: as, cibos et hor-
tamina gestant (Germ. 7) ; Agr. 13 and 443 quia Romanis Germanis·
que idem conducere et pacem quam bellum probabam (Anu. 1: 58);
quod arduum sibi, cetera legatis permisit (2z 20); juxta gratiam
aut fastus janitorum perpetiebantur (42 74); ac prim0‚ etc. (4: 72);
manus ac supplices voces ad Tiberium tendens (after Virgil), 2: 29 ;
cum voces, cum manus intentarent (32 36). Thus often, especially
in the Annals.

A decided characteristic of Tacitus is his frequent use of the
participial construction. In order to see this, we have but to compare
him with the earlier writers as to the number of such constructions
found in the same extent of simple narrative of a like nature. From
such a comparison, it appears that, while Caesar in the two hundred
words of the first two sections of the second book of his Gallie War
has but five participial constructions, and Sallust in Jug. 6-7 only
ten, and Livy in 21: 5 sixteen, Tacitus in Ann. 2: 11-12 has
twenty-four.

ξ 122. The metaphor, by which words are applied ιι’ῖοφιναῑίυεζῃ to
subjecta similar in some respect to those in which they have a literal
application, is very much used by Tacitus, and greatly enlivens his
narrative, though occasionally appearing a little far-fetched. His
