234 Noms. [Boon 111

aqentes (= “ and any other force actinq‚'' &c ) — annexu connubiis·
que gentiuml, “ by connection (i.e. commercial intercourse) and
intermarriage with other nations.”—civilibus infelixl. Having
favored the party of Brutus and Cassius, it was heavily mulcted by
the triumvirs (Heraeus). —emptionem aspernantisl, “ spurning
the purchase of such slaves.”· Hence such booty was useless to them
(irritum). —occidi coepere]. For this construction, see Intr. 14, b.
—munificentia municipum1, “by the munificence of the inhabi-
tants οἱ the free towns.'’ The ravages of war, though ever so terri·
ble, are always repaired more rapidly than is expected. Vespasian
also, it seems, was called upon to aid in repairing the loss (hor-
tabatur).

35. Assiderel, “ to encamp by.”—ambigui], “equivocally,”
“treacherously.”—nuntios famamque1, “messengers, and a re·
port.” Governed (as Calenum and Montanum also are) by misere.
This was done for a display (ostentui).

36. At Vitellius} The author now turns again to Vitellius,
whom he left at Rome, in the latter part of the last book, relapsing
into stupidity, after having been sufficiently aroused by rumors of
the approach of the Flavian forces to despatch Caecina with his
army to the Po. We find him in the same condition here3 indeed,

ο this was his normal condition.—curis . . . obtendebatJ, “ substi-

tuted pleasures for cares‚'' “ drowned cares in indulgence.” —ut
ignavia animalia . . . torpentquel. What a sarcasm on the be-
sotted emperor l—nemore Aricinol. A grove sixteen miles south·
east of Rome, on the Appian way, at the soot of the Alban Mount,
where Numa was reputed to have met the nymph Egeria for nightly
consultations (Liv. 1 :2l).—mixtus gaudio dolor]‚ ‘⁴ the sad news
mixed with joy‚” sad because he had proved a traitor, joyful because
he had been put in chains. —P. SabinumJ. See 2:92. Not to be
confounded with Flavius Sabinus, mayor of the city (sec. 69).
’ 54. Apud Cremonam, i.e. in the battle which ended in the de-
struction of Cremona.—confitentil, “if he had acknowledged the
defeat.'' The part. here stands in place of a conditional sentence
(lit. to him acknowledging it). —falsis ingravescebatj, ‘⁴ he ag-
gravated the case by falsehoods 3 ” thus neglecting remedie8‚ by pre-
tendingssthat there was nothing to remedy. —ac si . . . narraturil,
“and while likely to state things truly, is freely allowed.'’ Narratur-i
agrees with sermones, and is coordinate with plures. We see here a
shrewd insight into human nature.— augendae famae deerantl.
