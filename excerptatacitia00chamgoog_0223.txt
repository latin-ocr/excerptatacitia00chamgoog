sification having superseded that by centuria (see Dic. Antiq. p. 1008).
-cxsolutusL “ freed from.'' In their more popular form, the elec·
tions had been attended by bribery and solicitations of various
kinds, from which the senate chamber was comparatively free;
hence the people more readily acquiesced in the change. —mode·

nandosl, “ to be elected without repulse and solicitation,” i.e. without y

opposition on the part of the senate, or further demands on his part.
The emperor thus had the absolute choice of four out of the twelve
pretore (the manner of whose election is here under discussion), and
the nomination, and hence virtually the election of the others; as he
did also of the consuls and the other public functionaries.—tr1-
umphali vestaJ, i.e. the toqa picta (purple mixed with gold), such

17. Paucioribus tribunisl. There were sixty centurione and
six tribunes to a legion, which when full contained sixty centuries
(originally hundreds=6000), thirty maniples (of two hundred men
each), and ten cohorte (originally of six hundred men each). But
before the time of Marius, the term cohow-t was little used except of
auxiliary troops (and indeed is generally so used by Tacitus); and
