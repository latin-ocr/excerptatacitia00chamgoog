from the marines (legio classica), which Galba retained in his service3
but a multitude of other marines, whom Nero had held as reserves
at Rome, and who naturally preferred this service to that of the
navy, met Galba on his way to Rome, at the Mulvian bridge (sec. 87),
and demanded to be·continued in the land service. A fight ensued,
in which a large number of them were killed, and the rest put under
arrest.—multi ad hoc numerij, “in addition to this, many divi·
sions.'’ “A general expression for vexilla, cohortes, manipuli, alae,
turmae (Heraeus). These Nero had recalled, after having ordered
them east to the Caspian pass—unum aflquemJ, “any oue in

10. Famosusl. This word more commonly indicates an unenvia·
ble notoriety‚ like our word famous, but it seems here to mean
simply “renowned,'' “ distinguished.'’ Mucianus, at this time mili-
tary governor of Syria, became the chief agent of Vespasian in
securing for himself the principate of Rome.—sepositus], “laid
aside,'’ “ concealed.'' On account of the suspected displeasure (ira)
of the emperor Claudius, he seems to have prudently retired from
the public view for a while—prope ab exule]‚ “ as near from an
exile '' (see 2:76). We use a different but equivalent expression3
viz„ “as little removed from.'’ In his retirement, on the occasion
referred to, he was as little removed from an exile, as he was from a
prince under Vespasian.—quoties expedieratl, “as often as he
had entered upon an expedition.” A use of the verb not uncommon
in Tacitus, as ε secum expedire jubet, 11. 1: 88. Here the verb is in
the indic.; but, in. the hypothetical case expressed in the previous
sentence, cum denoting a repeated action is followed by the subJ.

diebantl, “ one would praise his public life, but his private life was
of bad repute '' (literally ‘⁸ heard itself unfavorably spoken of,'’ see
audio, Dic.). Acta is to be supplied with palam, which has the force
of an adiective (Intr. 11).—et cui . . . obtinerel, ‘⁸ and one better

being a relative or adjective sentence. We have here (as also in the
further account of Mucianus in 2: 5) the description of an adroit and
facile political manager.—occulta fatil, “ the secret workings of
