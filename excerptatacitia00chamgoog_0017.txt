He has the following rare forms: sordidius et abJectius, irrevoca-
bilior, toleratior‚ conspectior, conjunctior, junctissimus, metuentior,
excusatius, sollicitior, insignitior, improvisior‚ invisior, curatius, cu-
ratissimus, absolutissimus, impeditissimarum, strenuissimus, piissi-
mus, vulgarissimus.

But Cicero goes even farther than Tacitus in such innovations.
Livy, also, does not avoid them: as, cunctior, assuetior, impunitior,
insuperabilior, etc. Caesar and Sallust are very correct in this
particular.

ξ 8. Here, besides the adjective use of quidquam (in Dialogue on
Oratory‚ 29), we find merely what is found in classical authors3 viz„
quis sor uter, quis ille and hic ille in brachilogy, aliquis in negative

flexive pronouns, and the occasional nemo unus (“ no one in par·
ticular''), unus aliquis (“ any one in particular '').

sed, which is not found in Cicero and Caesar, though common in

5 10. Neuter adjective-3 as adverbs: aeternum, immensum, postre-
mum, supremum, praeceps, recens. Such usage is still farther ex·
tended in other post-classical prose-writers.

5 11. Adverbs instead of attributive acifjectives: multa invicem damna,

universae ultra gentes, nullis contra terriS‚ dites circum terrae, occu-
pare velut arcem ejus (his apparent citadel; similarly quasi in Cicero),

insigni familia ac perinde opibus, gravibus superne ictibus, impar
cominus pugna, Liburnicarum ibi navium, memoria prosperarum illic
rerum. This use of adverbs is common also in Livy.

5 12. Particular adverbs: adhuc (as yet), utcumque (however,
after some sort), both of which are found also in Livy. Non saltem
sor ne quidem, adeo non = nedum, ferme almost always jbr fere.

ξ 13. The influence of the poets is apparent in his frequent use of
the simple verb sor its compound: as, aspici, asperare, ardescere, cele·
