3³ssss and Thucydides. With Notes by R. H. ΜΑΤΠΕΒ, Professor

of Greek and German in Amherst College. 161no, 150

Tine extracts from Herodotus are from the 6ιὴ, 7th, and 8th Books, and contain
about the amount of that author usually read in a college course. To these is added
from Thucydides the F uneral Oration of Pericles. In the notes, the aim has been
to supply the wants of the pupil rather than of the toacher. to explain the text,
and to give such collateral information as the limited space of a text-book would
allow.

Mather's Selections is a most admirable text-book. 'I'he notes, both grammat-
ical and historical, are eminently lucid, pertinent, and judicious. 1 need hardly say

The text of this edition agrees in most places with that os Jahn. In the argu-
ments prefixed to each satire, the editor has endeavored to give a suggestive outline
ot the poet’s thoughts, and also to point out as clearly as possible, in the notes the
eotmection os one idea, or one part of the poem, with another.
