and now he turns aside to survey the scene of the conflict. —mu-
nere CaecinaeJ, i.e. his preparation for a gladiatorial show at Cre-
mona (see 67 ).—intra . . . diemJ. In about this time the scene
would have attained its highest degree of repulsiveneSS, from the
frightful appearance of the mangled remains and their offensive
odon—nec minus inhumanal, “ nor less revolting to human
nature.’' Though now strewn with roses, altars, &c., in honor οῖ
Vitellius, it was strewn also with the revolting remains of the slain.
quae . . . fecere1. The Vitellian forces, in turn, were beaten by
the forces of Vespasian in a terrible fight on this same field (3 : 18),
which might not have taken place there had they not favored the
cause of Vitellius—praefecti} These were the commanders of
the auxiliaries (troops furnished by allies), as the tribunes were ot·
the Roman legions (see 82, note). There were, besideS, prefects of
camps and of cities.— subiretJ. The common predicate of fors,
lacrimae, and misericordia, the number of the verb being determined
by that of the last noun. The subj. is used because the adjective
sentence expresses a result flowing from the character of the persons

peror or general, and serving him in various ways, as spies, in car-
rying despatches, and the like duties. They probably brought
despatches to the effect here named from Mucianus and Vespasian,
as this was before the Vespasian movement began (see next section).
——adoleverit1, subj. in an indirect question (H. 5253 A. and G.
190, 2). Such questions, from the very fact that they are indirect,
are but conceptions to the writer. — ut nullo aemuloj, ‘⁴ as though
there remained no rival.'' 'l'he abl. absolute is often used thus by
Tacitus with ut, quamvis, etsi, quanquam, and other concessive adverbS,
instead of a regular concessive sentence with a finite verb (see 3: 23
also Intr‘. 113; M. 428, Obs. 2).·—externas ωσι-εει, i.e. arbitrary,
savage ways, abhorrent to the comparatively humane and civffized
ways of the Romans.
