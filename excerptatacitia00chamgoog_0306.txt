Paulinus, as we have seen (H. 2: 32), was the ablest general of Otho
in his war with Vitellius (ΑΛ). 69). —-quem contubernio aestima-
retl, “ of whom he might form an estimate by tent companionship.”
His office was that of tribune. —neque segniter . . . retulit]‚
“ nor slothfully did he devote the office of tribune to pleasures‚ and
furioughs‚ and continued ignorance.’' —ingrata temporibm‚ etc.],
i.e. to the times of Nero, during whose reign this preliminary service
in Britain took place (Λα). 60). Some eighteen years later (Aa). 78)
he was made military governor of Britain⁴ by Vespasian (sec. 17, 18),
which office he retained seven years, when he was recalled by Domi·
tian, and died Am. 93.— expeditionem . . . continuisseL “ nor call
it an expedition or victory to have held those already conquered.”
—ne laureatis . . . eet], “not even with laurelled letters did he
despatch his exploits,” i.e. as if he considered them in some way
extraordinary. Ne — quidem denotes an advance to a stronger case.
The author, in his description of the course and character of Agri-
cola, is giving his ideal of an upright and able governor of a province ς
and certainly it is an admirable one.

18. Ordovicum]⁸ A people occupying the northern part of
Wales. — quibua volentibus . . . eratJ, “ those who desired war '³
(literally, “ to whom there was war wishing it '’). It is a Greek con·
struction (see Dem. De Cor. 115 also Intr. 29; M. 246, Obs. 3).—
mrda . . . inchoaturo]‚ “ were retarding and opposing circumstances
to his beginning the war.''

19. Animorum provinciae prudens1, “knowing the minds of
the province.”—quod plerisque . . . regerel. A sentiment not
unlike that in Proverbs (162 32) ε “ He that ruleth his spirit is better
than he that taketh a city.’' Domum here includes his suite and
attendants—centurionem . . . adscirel, i.e. to promote centu-
rions or soldiers to higher positions, or to a more desirable kind of
service (see H. 2: 93, note). —aequalitate muneruml, “by an
equality of burdens.” The rich were not exempted from taxation at
the expense of the poor, as is so often the case, and as appears to
have been the case there before this.—exactionem]. In some
editions we find auctionem instead of this, as referring to a supposed
increase of taxation under Vespasian.

29. Initio aestatisl. This, apparently, was in the beginning of
his seventh summer in Britain. He is represented as bearing the
affliction referred to with a manly fortitude, though not with a false
pride of Stoical indifference. —montem GrampiumJ. The Gram-
