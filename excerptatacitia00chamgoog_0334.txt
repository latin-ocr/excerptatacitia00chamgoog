XENOPHON’S MEMORABILIA.

With Introduction and notes by Professor smum, Ross Wlxans, College of New
Jersey. 16mo, 289 pages. SIAEO.

The text of this edition follows in the main that of Breitenbach (Berlin, 1878), and
every effort has been made to give the results of recent schohrship. The text is
separated into convenient divisit-ns by English summaries, which take the place of
the customary argument prefixed to the chapters, and put a logical analysis of the
text where it cannot escape the attention of the student. The notes are designedly
compact‚ yet are believed to contain all that is practically useful to the student.
The references to Goodwin's Grammar, his Moods and Tenses, to Hadley’s Gram-
mar, and occasionally to others have been made very full, especially on the earlier
portions of the text. The editor has also endeavored to supply brief sketches of
every thing of biographical, historical, or philosophical interest.

‘⁴ It supplies a want long felt, and Ι have no doubt will be largely used, as it de-
serves. The introduction of the summaries into the text adds greatly to its value,
while the notes are succinet, with good references and apt illustrations.'’ — Prof.
A. C. Mer-riam, Col-umbia Collegae, New york.

“ The notes are excellent, the paragraphing of the text is a great and valuable
help to students, and the book itself is a model of neatness. It is one of the few
unexceptionably well edited school-books in my libi-ary. I shall use it in my
classes exclusively when we read the ⁶ Memorabilia) ” -Prqfi C. M. Mass, Wes-
leyan University, Illinois.

“1 have used it with my Freshman Class during the past year with much satis-
faction. I particularly approve of the subdivisions of the chapters and the head-
notes to each of them, and have found the explanatory notes and grammatica!
references to be of great benefit to the pupils.'' —Prqsl H. W hitelcorne, Union Col-
leye, Schenectady, N. Y.

‘⁶ Winans's ⁴ Memorabilia ' has met the needs of our students excellently well.
The page is neat, the notes happy3 translations are sparse and discreet, and the
general references accurate and suggestive. We shall certainly continue its use.”
-Prqf- Jas. A. Towle, Ripon Colleye, Wisconsin.

 

XENOPHON’S SYMPOSIUM.

Edited, with notes, by Professor S. R. WmANs. 18mo, eloth, 96 pages. 50 cts.

⁵ The “ Symposium,'’ according to its original design, makes a delightful asterpiece
to the “ Memorabilia.’' In itself it has great value. As a source of information on
Attio morals and manners its value is not easily overestimated3 and its lively con-
versational style enables the student to apprecians Greek idiom and enjoy the spirit
of the language.
