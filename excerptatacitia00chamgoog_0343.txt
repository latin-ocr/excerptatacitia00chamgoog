Rev. A. J. MACLEANE, M.A. Revised and edited by R. H. cuasa,
A.M. mmo, 580 pages. amo.

'I'his edition of Horace is substantially the same with Mr. Macleane’s abridg·
ment of his larger edition in the Bibliotheca Classica. The text is unaltered. Only
such changes have been made in the notes as seemed necessary to adapt the book
tn the class room. Discussions respecting the various readings and disputed points
have been omitted; the arguments of the Odes have been introduced from the larger
work3 and Dr. Beck’s Introduction to the Metres has been appended to the notes.

by C. Ο. Fam-on, LL.D. Third Edition, revised‘by Pro·

sessor C. C. Goomvm. 12mo, 155 pp. 80 cents.

The Panegyricus has been selected for publication, partly because it is an ex-
cellent specimen of the best manner of IsocrateS, and partly because, by its plan, it
presents a review of the history of Athens from the mythical ages down to the
period following the treaty of Antalcidas, and is a convenient work to make the
text-book for lessons in Greek history. The present edition is by Prof. Goodwim
who has added grammatical and other notes.

Macleane's Commentary Is highly valued among scholars, but its price has, sor
the most part, kept it out of the reach of our undergraduates. Professor Hart’s

abridgment has now put into their hands all that would be of use to them in the ι

larger book. In addition, the editor has incorporated much that is useful from
the notes of Heinrich, of Mayor, and of other commentators3 and has inserted
notes and commenta of his own, including many explanations of peculim construc-
tion, and a considerable body of grammatical references.

The work of the American editor is done with excellent judgmeng and hin
additions to the notes will greatly increase their value for our students. — Profes-
