Tacitus„ which there always is in Cicero. But in Virgil we find
strata viarum = stratae viae.

Not only post-classical, but very uncommon even in the silver age
of the language‚ is the use of a preposition before such an adjective
in the singular: as, in extremo Ponticae orae (H. 3: 47) ; in promi·
nenti litoris (Ann. 1: 53); in proximo Campaniae (Ann. 4: 74) 3 post
multum vulnerum (Ann. 12: 56). We find this usage first in Livy,
then in Curtius, Justin, and‘Apuleius.

§3 41. The genitive with adverbs: aS‚ eo furoris venire 3 eo usque
corruptionis provectus est; eo contemptionis descensum; ire quoquo
terrarum3 huc arrogantiae venerat. We find in Cicero also the gen.
with ubi, abicumque and lonqe, but not with eo or huc. From the time
of Livy the usage became more common. The gen. with ut in Anu.
15: 53 (at quisque audentiae habuisset) is a pure Grecism.

Sponte with the gen. (found also in the elder Pliny and Lucan) is
found frequently in the History and Annals, but not in the smaller
writings of Tacitus.

§3 42. After the analogy of the objective genitive, the personal
pronouns in the gen. are used both subjectively and objectively, and
instead of the possessive pronoun as in the Greek: as, a primordio
sui (H. 3: 34) 3 primo sui incessu (H. 4: 24) ; nostri origine (Ann.
2: 54); insolentia nostri (Ann. 3: 38); initia nostri (Ann. 6: 32);
longam sui absentiam (15: 36). Something of this usage is found in
Cicero: in later writers it is found frequently.

ξ 43. The objective qenitive with verbs. Besides eqere and 1‘ndt’9ere,
with which the gen. is sometimes found in other authors als0, the
following are used with the case only in the Annals of Tacitus:
monere, for which strictly classical writers use a compound form, and
adipisci, after the analogy of potiri.

ς 44. The genitive with certain acljectives, expressing either, —

(a) A transitive relation, equivalent to a participle with its case ;
aa, properus (hastening for, seizing), providus, improvidus, prudenS,
praesciuS, callidus, rudis, acer, segnis, incuriosus, socors, tacitus, ex-
pers, and many others.

(b) Some particular or respect, like an abl. of relation or limitation,
very frequently with ani-mi .· as, incertus animi, also with laetu8‚ tur·
bidus, ferox, aeger, fidem, ingens, validuS, promptuS‚ captuS, diver-
sus. Already the comic writers and Cicero had used the phrase
pendere animi, and Livy nimius: incertus animi, and the like, but
very rarely. Tacitus, on the contrary, uses the construction in
