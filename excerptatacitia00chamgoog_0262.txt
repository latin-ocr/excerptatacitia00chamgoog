Tacitus abounds, and which give such life and enei-gy to his dis-
course (see Intr. 122).—haud fuerit longum1, “it will not take
long,'' lit„ “it will not have been long.'' This use of the perfect
subjunctive as a potential present or imperf„ or a sottened future,
in independent sentenceS, is common in Tacitus, and not uncommon
in other Latin authors, especially in negative sentences with the
impersonal suerit (see 76, note; A. 3: 3). In such cases, a condition
is usually implied in the context, as here.(i.e. “if 1 should attempt
it ''). The temple was at Paphos, in Cyprus.

3. Vetus memoria1. The subJect of perhibet, to be supplied
from perhibent in the next line. Here the word to be supplied is obvi-
ous 3 but Tacitus, in his desire to be brief, often leaves words to be
supplied from those of a quite different form and meaning, or to be
inferred from the general sense, or by zeuyma strains the meaning of
a word in making it apply in different senses in a sentence, as:
Caesarem et Augustum et omnia principatus vocabula cumulare
·(2: 80). Here cumulare, as applied to Caesarem et August-um, must
be taken in the sense, “they called him, '' but in its application to
vocabula it means “they heaped on him '’ (see Intr. 121).—con0ep-
tam maril. The root of her Greek name (Ἀφροδίτη) means “sea-
foam.’'—accitam], “was called in,” “introduced from abroad.'’
And as Cinyras founded the temple, and Tamiras introduced the
service, it w‘as arranged, the narrative goes on to say, that the pos-
terity of both families should superintend the ceremonies 3 but at
length, from the jealousy of the royal family, the services of the
foreign family (hospites) were wholly dispensed with.-precibus

. . adolenturl, “ the altars are redolent with prayers and pure
fire ''(i.e. fire unmingledwith the flesh and blood of victims). —simw
lacrum deael. The image was simply a cone. The description,
however, is such as to impart the air of mystery to it which the
subJect seemed to require. Such side accounts of interesting objects
and circumstances are characteristic of Tacitus.

4. Per ambagesl, “through the enigmatical responses of the
oracle.''—fiducia], “as a security.’' Thus also fides in the next
sconem—oppugnatione . . . reliqua} The siege of Jerusalem
was left to Titus, while Vespasian set out for Rome to take posses-
sion οῗ the government. Titus was about to commence the siege
as the fragment which remains of the fifth book of this History
mosea—pervicaciam superstitionisl. For the prejudice ot the
Romans against the Jews, see Ann. 15: 44, note.—ut supra me·
