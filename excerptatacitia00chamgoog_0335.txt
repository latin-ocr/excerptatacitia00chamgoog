“ I am using Fernald's Seleetions from Greek Historians with a class this term,
and regard it as a most excellent text-book, its notes being always oareful and
accurate, and not so full or numerous as to make the students’ work too easy.” —

Pros. H. Ζ. McLain, Wabash Colleye, Crawfordsville, Jnd.

“ It is by far the best selection 1 have seen, and should, I think, be extensively
‘ued- Ι shall use it with some class during the coming year.'’—Prqf. E. Aleo-
mder, Tenues-see Universily, Knooeville, Tenn.

“ Such a book is especially needed to follow Xenophon’s Anabasis. ΤῙιο excel-
·ence of the notes lies in just enough judicious help, with frequent reference to the
Grammars and to the best authorities on interpretation and Greek literature. A .
student who will patiently study this book, guided by the helpful directions in the
notes, will gain an extensive and accurate knowledge of history.''—Prqf. J. F
