Paulinus, as we have seen (H. 2: 32), was the ablest general of Otho
in his war with Vitellius (ΑΛ). 69). —·quem contubernio aestima-
retl, “ of whom he might form an estimate by tent companionship.”
His office was that of tribune. —neque segniter . . . retulitJ,
“ nor slothfully did he devote the office of tribune to pleasures, and
furioughs, and continued ignorance.’' —ingrata temporibQ etc.]‚
i.e. to the times of Nero, during whose reign this preliminary service
in Britain took place (aa). 60). Some cighteen years later (Aa). 78)
he was made military governor of Britain by Vespasian (sec. 17, 18),
which office he retained seven years, when he was recalled by Domi-
tian, and died Am. 93. - expeditionem . . . continuiseeJ, “ nor call
it an expedition or victory to have held those already conquered.''
—ne laureatis . . . eet], “not even with laurelled letters did he
despatch his exploits,'' i.e. as it he considered them in some way
extraordinary. Ne — quidem denotes an advance to a stronger case.

mrda . . . inchoatur01, “ were retarding and opposing circumstances
to his beginning the war.''

19. Animorum provinciae prudens1, “knowing the minds of
the province.'’—quod plerisque . . . regerel. A sentiment not
unlike that in Proverbs (lssz 32) ε “ He that ruleth his spirit is better
than he that taketh a city.'’ Domum here includes his suite and
attendants. ——centurionem . . . adscirel, i.e. to promote centu-
rions or soldiers to higher positions, or to a more desirable kind of
service (see Η. 2; 93, note). —aequalitate muneruml, “by an
equality of burdens.'’ The rich were not exempted from taxation at
the expense of the poor, as is so often the case, and as appears to
have been the case there before this.—exaetionem]. In some
editions we find auctionem instead of this, as referring to a supposed
increase of taxation under Vespasiau.

29. Initio aestatisl. This, apparently, was in the beginning of
his seventh summer in Britain. He is represented as bearing the
