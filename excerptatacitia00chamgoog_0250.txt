whole by an account of the life and times of Augustus. These tasks,
however, he did not live to accomplish. The History has the greater
freshness and fulness, as being the record of contemporaneous events,
while the Annals were made up from the meagre records of the past.
Both exhibit the same striking peculiarities of genius. The History
was published first, probably about the year Aa). 100. in the early
part of the reign of Trajan.

Sao. 2. opus aggred-ior, et0.]. This section is a sort ot sum·
mary or table of contenta prefixed to the history of the whole
period, describing its general character, and indicating some of the
leading events. The four princes who came to their end by violence
(ferro) were Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Domitian. The three civil
wars (trina poetic for tria) were those between Otho and Vitellius,
between Vitellius and Vespasian, and between L. Antonius and
Domitian. In the general confusion incident to the civil wars just
named, some of the subject peoples very naturally took up arms
against the government, as the Sarmatians (see 1 ε 79; 3: ὃς 4: 4, 54),
the Dacians ( 3: 463 4: 54), who inflicted as well as received defeats
(cladibus mutuis). of the rising of the Suevi there is no further
mention in the history which is now extant. For the account of one
pretended Nero, see 2: 8. As there were conflicting reports in re·

in the destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii by an eruption of
Mount Vesuvius, iu the reign of Titus (urbes is probably a spurious
reading). The capitol was burned by the Vitellian soldiers in their
conflict with those of Vespasian (32 71). The slaughters on the
cliffs or rocky islanda (scopuli) were those of political criminals.
Society being divided into bitter factions, the government corrupt
and cruel, and carried on largely through spies, any sort of emi·
nence in one, even in virtue, excited suspicion against him, as being
dangerous to the wicked men in authority, and rendered him liable
to be arraigned as such by some one of the troops of informers
(delatores) hanging around the court, and among whom the highest
honors and rewards of the state (sacerdotia, consulatus, &c.), were
divided. Woe to the state where virtue is treated as a crime! The
phrase, aqerent . . . terrore, refers evidently to the violent and high-
handed proceedings of these informers, who had obtained power at
court (interiorem potentiam), and may be rendered “ forced, over-
turned all things by hatred and sear.'' The second verb is added as
