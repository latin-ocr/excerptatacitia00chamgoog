166 NOTES. [Boox Ι.

i.e. the commission of ten men appointed to prepare the Twelve
Tables of the laws, and who had absolute governmental powers
granted them for two years (303 and 304 after the founding of the
city, 13.c. 451, 450). During the few months beyond this time in
which they exercised these powerS, they maintained themselves by
force—tribunorum . . . jusl. Military tribunes with consular
authority held the government‚ by appointment from year to year,
nearly every year from AJJ. 310 to 3883 13.c. 444-366.—n0n
Cinnae, etc.]. Cinna was consul for four years in successim, from
Β. c. 87-84 inclusive, and Sulla was dictator for the same number of
years, from 13.c. 82-79. These repeated electioris for so long a period
were considered irregular, and were carried by overawing influ-
ences. —et Pompei . . . cessere} The reference here is to the two
triumvirate governments, the first of Julius Caesar, with Pompey and
Crassus, and the second of Augustus Caesar, with Lepidus and
Antony. In both cases, the power soon fell into the hands of the
Caesar; in the first case, by the crushing defeat of Pompey at the
battle of Pharsalia, in Thrace (13.c. 48); and, in the second case, by
the equally crushing defeat of Antony at the battle of Actium, on
the coast of Epirus (3.0. 31).—nomine principis} This was to
avoid the odium attached to the names Iciny and dictator. Henceforth
principatus and principium were used as equivalent to imperium.—

to flattery; hence when flattery isin vogue, and it would be dangerous
not to use it, they cease to write. For the subj. with donec (until),

The order of these conjunctions (que, et, ac) is interchangeable in
different cases (Intr. 63).—recentibus odiisl, “ with animosities
still fresh.'’—et extremal, “and these the last.'’ Hence et here is
explicative.—et cetera]‚ i.e. other matters to the death of Nero,
the beginning of his History, which had been already published.—
