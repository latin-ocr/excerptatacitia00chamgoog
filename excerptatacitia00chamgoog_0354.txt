JUVENAL. Thirteen Satires of Juvenal, with Notes and
Introduction by G. A. S1Mcox, M.A.‚ Fellow of Queen’s Colle-ge,
Oxford. Second Edition‚ revised and enlarged. (Catena Classi-
corum.) 16m0‚ 225 pages. 8120.

The text of this edition is mainly that of Jahn3 variatione are noticed when they
occur, and the editor's reasons for the choice are given. The notes are original and

scholariis, and are marked by a real desire to place in the hands of the learner all
that is most effective to throw light upon the author. The introduction is calcu·

lated to give the student much insight into the writings of Juvenal and their rela- '

tien to his age.

The charm of Mr. Simcox’s work lies in the very scholar-ly character of hi·
notes and their freshncss. It will be of great value to those who are glad to avail
gijgpsg'lgzeos 29ng clear and terse annotation.—-Prqfeswr F. P. Naslz, liobart Cot-

< ‘71 *ATHER'S SELECTIONs. Selections from Herodotus
²102 l and Thucydides. With Notes by R. H. MATHER‚ Professor

of Greek and German in Amherst College. mmo, 150
pagee. 90 ets,

  

Tire extr-acts from Herodotus are from the eth, 7th, and 8th Books‚ and contain
about the amount of that author usually read in a college course. To these is added
from Thucydides the FuneralOration oi Pericles. In the notes, the aim has been
to supply the wants of the pupil rather than of the teacher, to explain the text, ⁷
and to give such collateral information as the limited space of a text—book would
allow.

Mather’s Selections is a most admirable text-book. The notes, both grammat-
ical and historical, are eminently lucidupertinent, and judicious. Ι need hardly say

Ι am pleased with the Selections themselves, because of their exceedingly inter·-
esting nature3 pleased with the amount selected, because it is just what will be read
in a tel-1113 pleased with the notes, because of their brevity‚ pertinence‚ and compre·

The text of this edition agrees in most places with that of Jahn. In the argu-
ments prefixed to each satire, the editor has endeavored to give a suggestive outline
of the poet’s thoughts, and also to point out as clearly as possible, m the notu the
emmection of one idea, or one part of the poem, with another.
