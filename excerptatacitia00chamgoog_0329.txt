follows: 1. 1t is complete, requiring no grammar for those who take Latin for
a short time. 2. It is concise without being deficient in material for drill. 3. It
is judicious both in the arrangement of vocabularies, notes, &c., and also in the
gradation of matter. 4. The “Essentials of Grammar” and the “Notes on Syn-
tax ’² give, in about 90 pages, a very useful and conveniently arranged sumniary of
all that the ordinary pupil needs to know. 5. The brief synopsis of English
Grammar gives an opportunity (much needed) to review the fundamentals of Eng-
lish Grammar, and compare and contrast them with those of Latin Grammar.
Ι find no other book that combines these advantages.

NarnAn Tnom’son, A.M.‚ Principa] Lawrence Academy, Croton, Mass. —
It is altogether the best Latin book sor beginners with which Ι am acquainted.

Professor H. W. Jonxs‘ron, Illinois Colle9e‚ Jacksonville, Illinois. -It seems
to me superior to any book of the kind hitherto published, and 1 regard the Essen-
tials of Latin Grammar as the best statement possible of what a boy must learn in
his first year.

Profes‘sor Jorm L. Comum, V anderbilt Preparatory School, Nashville, Terin.—
With reference to the book, 1 can speak only in the highest terms. Indeed, Ι (10
not think that there has ever been issued an Elementary Latin Exercise Book that
can compare with it in any respect. 1 say this advisedly, as 1 have examined
almost all issucd in this country, and the most prominent English ones3 and, with-
out hesitation, 1 pronounce Mr. Comstock's the best book of its kind published.

Professor H. C. M1ss1mmz, Hiyh School. Eric, Pa.—It is very easy to see
that Comstock's F irst Latin Book is the work of a thorough teacher, who has had
actual experience in the class-room with the difficulties which beginners in Latin
usually meet. Its classification and methods are thorough and complete. The
language is so clear, so simple, and school-like, that the dullest pupil‚ if he read
carefully‚ should understand without further explanation. Mr. Comstock has hit
the nail on the head. He knows just what and just how much grammar is needed
for good, clean work. We have had Leighton and Jones, - both good, — but we
like Comstock more, because it is better.

Professor R. F. Psxxnm, IIeacl-Master Buffalo Latin School, Buffalo,
N. Y.—1 have examined with care Comstock's First Lessons in Latin. The book
shows the hand of a practical tcacher, who understands the difficulties which are*
constantly encountered by the beginner in Latin. 1 consider it the best book yet
published on the subject, and shall at once use it in the Buffalo Latin School.
