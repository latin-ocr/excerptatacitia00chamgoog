mmonucnon. 19

dinem transferebat (Ann. 13: 45). Also with the general relative:
quoquo inclinarent (Ann. 3: 74). Very rare in strictly classical
authors, most frequent in Livy, SuetoniuS, and Nepos.

ἓ 86. Attractae'on into tlte case qs tlte relative.- ad ea quis (quibus)
maxime fidebant in populum Romanum officiis (instead of officia,
Anu. 4: 56). This attraction of the noun is rare in prose, but quite
common in the poets. But the attraction of the attribute into the case
of the relative is more common in classical authors: gladii, quos
praelongos (instead of praelonyi) regunt (H. 1: 79); quae utrubique
pulchra (Ann- 6: 37).

5 87. The relative does not always ayree with its antecedent.- raptis,
quod cuique obvium, telis (H. 3 ε 80) ; legationes — quorum (= quarum
rerum) copia fessi patres (32 63). The neuter plural of the relative
is sometimes used thus by Cicero, and by Sallust and Livy in both
the singular and the plural.

C. ΤΕΜΡΟΒΑῙ, SENTENcEs.

5 88. A repeated action is often expressed by the subjunctive after
cum, quoties, ubi, ut, but only in the History and AnnaIS, and once
after abi in Agr. 9. Only occasionally in Cicero and Livy, not at all
in Sallust and Velleius3 but very frequently in the writers of the
silver age of the language, especially in Suetonius.

5 89. Postquam is found not only with the perfect, asin the earlier
writers, but often also with the imperfect and pluperfect ; and occa-
sionally even with the present of the verbs videre, intellz'yere, and
habere (Anu. 14: 44).

ἓ 90. Dum (while) with the imperfect and perfect, as in Cicero.
With the indicative of the present even in indirect de'scoarse, as it had
been before by Livy and Curtius.

Dum sometimes has a causal meaniny (“ inasmuch as,'’ “ since ''):
dum affirmant (H. 1: 22) ; dum vetera extollimus (Ann. 2: 88).
Thus often in the Annals, rare in Cicer0, but common with the later
writers.
εις 91. Donec (until) is osten found with the subjunctive even

where a reality or fact is related. It almost supersedes the use of
'quoad in Tacitus, which is found only in the meaning “as long as,”
and that only in Ann. 4: 61, and 6: 51.

ἓ 92. The histor-icat infinitiva in subordinate sentences, with cum, ubi,

ut, postquam, and donec.-
