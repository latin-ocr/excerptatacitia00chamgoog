manner the neuter adjective-s in the Annals: periculoso (1: 6); ita
vasto et profundo (22 24); libero (32 60).

These absolute forms are not found in his smaller writingS, and
only six times in the History‚ and are characteristic of the style of
the Annals. They are little used by earlier prose writers.

THE STYLE OF TACITUS.

*l* 5 116. Tacitus has many peculiarities in his arranqement qf words.
The cognomen is sometimes placed before the gentile name; ae,
Secundus Pomponius, Massa Bebius, Gallus Asinius, This was rare
in strictly classical writers, but began with Livy, and is particularly
common in Valeius. The designation of the office sometimes pre·
cedes the name3 as, imperator Augustus, Caesar Titus, procurator
Marius, etc. This is rare in Cicero and Cassan—Most frequent is
his transposition of the preposition from its proper place before its
word to some other position, called Anastroplze. He places it not only
after the pronouns hic or qui, which is common in classical writers, but
sometimes in his History, and often in the Annals, places it after:
(a) A noun without an attribute : humantis. ultra, Tiberim
