President Felton‚ by his tastes and his studies, was especially fitted for the diffi-
cult task of editing Aristophanes, and the notes of these two books show with what
skin and thoroughness the congenial labor has been performed. Great care has been
taken to explain the judicial expressions and the frequent allusions to the politic-al
and socia} life of Athens. In the new editions, revised by Professor Goodwin‚ the
commentary has been enlarged by references to his Moods and Tenses of the
Greek Verb.
