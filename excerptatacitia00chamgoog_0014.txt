viii PREFACE.

more· than one hundred and fifty years later than
Cicero and Caesar, and more than one hundred years
after Horace, Livy, and Sallust. The bloom of the
Latin literature had passed, and it was fast declining
towards what has been called the silver age. The
language had changed considerably from the Cicero-
nian standard, but, in the hands of a writer like
TacitUS, was still a magnificent instrument for the
expression of thought. He was well acquainted with
it in its whole compaSS, and laid it under contribu-
tion in all its forms, — literally drawing from it
“ things new and old.'' To show the peculiarities of
his language‘and style, — which are chiefly embraced
under the usual classification of them, as brevitaS,
varietas, color poetieu3‚—I have prefixed, as 311 111-
troduction, a translation of the comprehensive essay
of Dr. A. Draeger on the subject.

It only remains to be said that the text here used
is that of the latest recension of Charles Halm, the
standard of nearly all the recent editions of Tacitus3
with which I have scarcely ventured to do more than
to change the spelling, so as to make it correspond in
the main to that of the Latin Lexicons in use in this
country.
