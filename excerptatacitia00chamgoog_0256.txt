his elevation to the principate. This acquiescence by Vespasian,
without factione opposition, in the government of Galba, was one of
the many things which prognosticated his own ultimate accession.
The Flavian Dynasty (of Vespasiani and his two sons, Titus and
Domitian) is the main subject of this history ; the reigns of Galba,
Otho, and Vitellius, were transitory, and merely preliminary. 1t was
but a year of civil war, - ‘⁶ that single long year of Galba, Otho, and
Vitellius,'' as he calls it in the Dialogue on Eloquence (17).

11. Domui retinerel, i.e. to keep the province more directly
under the government and influence of the emperor. The govern-
ment and revenues of the different provinces were divided between
the emperor and the senate. The other imperial provinces of any
considerable importance were governed by leqati C'aeE'aris, taken from
those who had been consuls or praetors, or from the senators, and
their finances managed by procurators, who were either knights or
freedmen3 but Egypt was governed by a prefect (see 3:74), ap-

former kings (loco regum). The dignity of the office, therefore, was

of Macer. On the death of Nero, Macer, governor of Africa, had
endeavored to produce a revolution at Rome in his own favor by
cutting off the supply of grain (sec. 7), and had been put to death by
Galba for this attempt. The province of Africa proper embraced
merely the territory of ancient Carthage. The two Mauritaniae
(i.e. Caesariensis and Tingitana) were immediately west of the
province of Africa. Raetia was north ,of the Alps in the Tyrol
region, and Noricum immediately east of it. These and some other
small provinces were governed by procurators of the emperor with
but a civil posse of soldiers (procuratoribus here, without ab, is re·
gar-ded as in the dat„ M. 250).—inermes provincial, “the
provinces without armies.'' Besides Italy, which was governed
directly from Rome, these were such as the Gallie provinces, which
were overawed by the German armies on the Rhine‚ Greece, esc.
