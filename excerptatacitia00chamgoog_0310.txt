Tacitus gives an account in his History (4 z 5), was a senator, and
was condemned to death by the senate (at the dictation of the em·
peror, of course), under the pretext that he had represented in a
farce, under false names, the domestic infelicities of Domitian and
his wife. Tacitus being a member of the senate speaks of himself
as having been compelled to take a part in this horrid deed of con-
demning to death a fellow senator.—nos . . . perfuditl. Rusti·
cus (as we have seen, sec. 2), was condemned to death for eulogizing
Paetus Thrasea, and Senecio for eulogizing Helvidius Priscus. On
the contrary, Mauricus, a brother of Rusticus, was only banished.
Perfudit, the common predicate of visus (“ the sight '’), and SeneciO,
means with the first “struck with horror,” and with the last
“sprinkled.'' This is zeuyma (see Intr. 121).—cum . . . subscrib-
erentuxl, “when even our groans (i.e. at the sad state of public
affairs) were secretly noted down,’' i.e. to be used against them as
evidence of disloyalty.—quo se . . . muniebatl. What a sar-
casm on the wicked emperor, that his face was so impudent and red
that lte could not blush! —innocentiam principi donares], i.e. by
meeting his fate cheerfully, without any complaints of injury or
neglect on the part of the emperor. — ante quadrienniumL “ four
years before.'' Tacitus, it seemS, had been absent this length of
time, perhaps in the administration of his pretorian province.

self, his wife, and her mother.”—non qui . . . imaginibusJ, “not
because Ι think we should reject statues.” But 1 will not mar the
beauty of this section by any further comments.
