ac nihil arduum fatis1. Another species of attraction, by which
what is properly a subordinate causal sentence becomes an indepen-
dent sentence, co-ordinate with those which precede it 3 instead of ε
ac quod nihil arduum esset fatis (“ and because nothing was too
difficult for the fates'').

83. Ipso spatio), “by the very time occupied.'’—vexil.lario-
rum], i.e. detachments from the other legions, which served under a
separate standard called vexillum (see 89). But vexillarius in the sing.
means the bearer of the vexillum (22 17 ).—Byzantium]‚ ‘⁴ to Byzan·
tium,'' now Constantinople. From this place he might take his
troops north to Moesia, or w'est to Dyrrachium in Illyricum and
close that port, while he guarded the coast of Italy by his ships of
war (longis navibus) in the Adriatic (versum in Italiam mare).
Tarentum and Brundusium (the latter of which was connected with
Rome by the Appian Way) were the principal ports on the eastern
coast of Italy. ‘With his forces thus arranged, Greece and Asia would
be safe from any hostile attack from Rome, and Vitellius would not

(obstinante) as afterwards to obtaining exorbitant taxes (iniquitates).”
Hence the abuse not only continued, but grew worse. Taxes are
generally paid reluctantly, and often regarded as iniqnities even when
levied on just and uniform principles. Avarice was a prominent
fault in Vespasian (see sec. 5).

86. Bedriacensis pugnae). Having been conquered in this
battle (41, 44), they were readily carried over to the cause of Ves-
pasian by the influence (vi precipua) of their commander. —falsi),
“of a fraud.'’ He was party to forging a will (Ann. 14: 40). Ban-

leading spirit and by far the ablest general in the army of Vespasian,
fully sustaining the terse description of his character in the following
sentences. —raptoxn largitor (see Intr. 4). —procurator), the
imperial tax-gatherer in the province. He could not have obtained
