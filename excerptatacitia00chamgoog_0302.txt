LIFE OF AGRICOLA.

Inrnonuc‘ronr Nora—Tacitus was the son-in·law of Agricola,
and narrates his life with an affectionate reverence suited to that
relation, and a just appreciation of his character and genius. Pass-
ing rapidly over his birth and his education at Marseille8‚ his tribune-
ship in Britain under PaulinuS, his questorship in Asia, his govern-
ment of Aquitania, and his elevation to the consulship, he devotes
the larger portion of the tract to his government of Britain, which
he held for seven yearS, during which time he subdued nearly the
whole island, and introduced many elements of the Roman civiliza-
tion. The Life of Agricola appears to have been published in the
reign of Nerva (see 3), earlier than either his History or his Annals,
probably about Λα). 98.

they had done it, — though the personal agent is very often found with-
out the preposition ab, as though in the dat„ after passive verbs in Taci-
tus (Intr. 36; M. 250). They were put to death by Domitian (sec. 45).
Thrasea was the father-in-law of Helvidius. They were both high·
minded Stoic philosophers. For an· account of Helvidius, see Hist-
4 : 53 and for Rusticus and Thrasea, see Ann. 16: 21-26. —in comi-
tio ao foro urerenturl. The comitium and forum were separated
only by the rostra, from which the orators addressed the people.
Their books were to be burned there by the commissioners (triumvi-
ris), because it was a place conspicuous for its publicity. — sapien·
tiae professoribuSJ. The Stoic philosophy, with its stem, unyield-
ing principles, nurtured a form of character highly offensive to such
frivolous and wicked rulers as Nero and Domitian. They attempted,
therefore, to rid themselves of its influence by killing its professors
and burning their books. — Vetus aetasl, i.e. the age of the
