2. Adversativc conjunctione.

§ 67. Non modo—sed (without etiam or quoque), found only in the
larger works of Tacitus, was sparingly used by Cicero and Sallust,
and commonly used only after the time of Livy. We also find sed et
instead of sed etiam in Ann. 1:·12; 14: 21; Germ. 17, 35, 45.

In other places in the History and Annals we find non modo or non

solum followed merely by etiam or quoque without sed .· as, H. 2: 27 ;
Ann. 3: 19, 4. 355 once also in Livy.

3. Disjttnctive Conjunctions.

5 68. Vel instead of aut.- oblivione vel gloria (Η. 1: 21); vel si
relinqueretur (Ann. 13: 41); vincendum vel cadendum (Ann. 14: 35).
Sive instead of aut.- se Vitellio sive Othoni obsidem fore (H. 2: 1).
Vel-sive.- Dialog. 5. Sive—an.- sive fatali vecordia an—ratus (Ann.
11: 26). Often sive instead of sive-sive.

The interchange of the particles is only apparent in Ann. 14: 7,
sive servitia armaret vel militem accenderet sive, etc. Here vel is
subordinate to the sive, and not its coordinate. So in Ann. 14: 59
(sive-an); H. 3: 8 (vel-an); 2: 41 (an-vel).

4. Causa! conjunctions.

§ 69. namque is found in the Annals before vowels as well as
before consonante. It stands after one or more words in its sentence
in Ann. 1: 5 ἃ. 4: 21, as in the poets‚ also in Livy and the later
w ’ .

ῃλξῗεῒιρε enim only in Dialogue 35. As a like pleonasm we find in
after times: nempe ergo, nempe igitur, quia enim, quod enim, ergo
igitur.

*F ᾖ 70. The genuine asyndeton, denoting the rapid progr-ess of an
action, and used more or less by all historical writers, was a great
favorite with Tacitus (see Anu. 1: 28, 41, 64, 703 2: 19; 15: 69). It
was also often employed by him in giving an outline statement of

facts (as in H. 1: 2), or in a brief sketch of a case in indirect dis-
course, as in Ann. 3: 69.

-δ 71. Enumerative asyndeton.
(1) Simple enumeration of particulars without tendinq to α cllum.-
