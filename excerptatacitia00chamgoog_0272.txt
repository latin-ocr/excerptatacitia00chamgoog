forces.”—praeeuntem sacramentum]‚ “ dictating the military
oath to them.'' That the soldiers did not respond in repeating after
him the oath of allegiance to Vitellius, showed that they were really
committed to himself (ipsi paratus). ·- quod transissetJ, “ because,
as lie said within himself, it had gone to Moesia from Syria ’' (Tyler).
The snbj. presente the reason subjectively, as it lay in his own mind,
i.e. as conceived by him3 and not objectively as a mere matter of
fact, which would have required the indic. (M. 3573 H. 520).—
myticij. Including the provinces of Moesia, Pannonia, and Delma-
tia, in which there were six legions (Heraeus).—sexagi.noe aetatis
minosJ. This was the age of Vespasian, and stands for himself, as
an impressive representation of what he had at stake in goingto
war. Notice the concentrated wisdom of the closing sentences of

, this section.

75. Versabatur . . . robu11. Vitellius had the larger part of
the eight German legions in his army. —presenti . . . praemium]‚
“a reward for a crime committed in a moment, offered by the oppo-
site party ’' (i.e. by an enemy, a rival). Facinus and scelus both in·
dicate acts of marked and decisive character: the first as a daring
act (usually crimina13 but see sec. 50), the second as a wicked,
malicious act. The allusion here, of course, is to assassination. For
the assassination of ScribonianuS, see Ann. 12: 52.

76. His pavoribusl. For the use of the plural of abstract
nouns by Tacitus, see Intr. 1.—simul . . . adjiciatneJ. A per-
sonal instead of an impersonal construction, the principal clause
being attracted into the construction of the subordinate clauses in-
stead of: considerandum est, ipsene qui suadet adjiciat. Such a
construction saves pauseS, and hence favors rapidity of mov‘ement.
It is often resorted to by Tacitus (see ceterae . . . sperabantur,
sec. 74), and not unfrequently to the sacrifice of elegance. —nec

. . . expaveris]‚ “ nor ca'n you fear the appearance of flattery,”
i.e. in being thus nominated to succeed such a wretch as Vitellius.
Both expaveris, andfuerit which follows in the next sentence, are in
the perf. subj. to express, with greater vivacity and in a sostened
form, a present or future idea (M. 350, b.‚· see sec. 2, note). For the
acc. with expavescere, see Intr. 25.—a laude propiusl. See 1: 10,
note—non adversus . . . imaginibusJ. The emperors were
deified after their death, hence Augustus is spoken of as divi, and
being a very wise and able governor is aptly described by acerrimam
