mnonncmon. 21

11, 59, and often. Compare Livy 25: 38, quo audacius erat, magis
placebat.

(b) mayis wanting in one member: quanto quis audacia promptus,
tanto magis fidus (Ann. 1: 57); pacem quam bellum probabam (A’nn.
1: 58) ; quanto inopina, tanto majora (Ann. 1: 68) ; miseratio quam
invidia augebatur (Ann. 3: 17), also 3: 43, 4: 48. Indeed‚ the com·
parison is rarely expressed in complete form.

(c) lee positive for the comparative .· vehementius quam caute
(Agr. 4); acrius quam considerate (H. 1: 83); quantum hebes— tanto
promptior (H. 2: 99). Similar to this is Ann. 2: 73, tanto promptius
assecuturum gloriam militiae, quantum—praestitisset (the compara-
tive idea being contained in the verb). So in Livy, 5: 10.

3. Sentences denotiny Consequence or Result.

5 98. Ut with the subj. of the historical perfect is not found in the
Dialogue or in Germania, but is common in the History and the An-
nals: as, H. 1: 24; Ann. 1: 18, 56, 80. This is usually preceded by
adeo, tantus, tam, more rarely by is or eo, and once by ita (Agr. 18).
This use of the tense in Cicero and Caesar is very rare, is wholly
wanting in Sallust, somewhat used by Livy, and very frequently by
Suetonius and Nepos.

¹ 5 99. Quin and quominus.— Quin in many places in the Annals has
almost an adversative meaning: Tiberium non fortuna, non solitudines
protegebant quin tormenta pectoris —fateretur (δε 6). Silurum gens
non clementia mutabatur quin bellum sumeret (= sed bellum sump-
sit, 12: 32), also 3: 27, 6: 38, 11: 22. So in Cicer0, Ad Fam. 5: 12:
deesse mihi nolui quin te admonerem.

Quin instead of quo minus (Ann. 14: 29) : quin ultra bellum prope-
ret, morte prohibitus est.

Quo minus also is sometimes adversative in meaning: as, Agr. 203
Ann. 1: 21, nihil reliqui faciunt quo minus invidiam—permoverent;
also 5: 5, 13: 14, 14: 39. In the History, quo minus is found instead of
quin or the infin.

Tacitus uses both these particles more extensively than other
writers.

E. CAusAr. Saura-Noas.

ἓ 100. Quando in a causal sense: H. 1: 90 ; Ann. 1 ι 44, 4: 64, and
often. Thus, also, not only in the poets‚ but in Cicero, Livy, and
Suetonius. ¹
