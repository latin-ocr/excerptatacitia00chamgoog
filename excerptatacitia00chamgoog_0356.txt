The editor has retained all in Mr. Jebb's notes that seemed most valuable to
teachers and more advanced collegiate scholare, ant. ..as added references to several
of the best American grammars, and explanations of difficult passages, when the
n'otes of the English edition seemed too meagre.

It is rare to find an edition of a classic author so admirably adapted to the wants
of studente as Mr. Jebb’s Electra. 1 hope this new edition will aid in making it
better known in our colleges3 and 1 am glad to see how much Prof. Mather has
done to that good end. -Prosessor W. W. Goodwin, Harvard Colleye.

It is a handsome volume and a good text-book. 1 am sure teachers and pupils
will find it to be what they want in the study of the favorite play of the prince οἱ
tragic poets. — Professor W. S. Tylen Amhersc calleyo.

main parts. All biographical and historical information, which seemed to be re·

of Dr. Draeger’s excellent essay on the peculiarities οἱ the language and style 01

A very interesting and useful text-book has been made up by these admirable
selections. The notes are able and judic-iens, and supply just the information
needed by studeuts. Dr. Draeger’s exhaustive essay on the language and st le
of Tacitus is of the greatest value to scholars. —Thomas Chasa, president Haver ord
