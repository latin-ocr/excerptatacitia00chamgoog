Boon 1.] HISTORY. 199

though the first was inadequate to express the degree of their vio-
lence. What a specimen of vivid, intense, and comprehensive nar-
rative we have in this section! Words are used as sparingly and
with as much weight as though they were ingots of gold,—quot
verba, tot pondera.

3. ut non . . . prodideritl, “that it may not have produced
even good exampleS.” We should say, “that it did not produce.'’
The fact asserted was a real one, and the author proceeds to name
the examples3 but by using the subj. mood it is presented more
delicately as a bare conception or possibility, while the perf. indicates
that the fact had been realized v'n particular cases willein the period then
closed, but not continuously, which would have required the imperf.
subj. The subj. in subordinate clauses regularly accompanies ut
denoting a result (Intr. 98; A. and G. 182, 1).—supremae . . . ne-
cessitateSJ, ‘⁸ the extremities of renowned men were supreme ; '’ as,
for instance, want, exile, risk of life, &a The “extremity itsels''
(ipsa necessitas) of course was death. The singular here differs
from the plural very much as in our language. By the omission of
copulatives and auxiliary verbs here, as in so many other places in
TacituS, the main ideas stand out more prominent, and the effect

is greatly heightened (see Intr. 20 and 70-75).-1aeta . . . mani-
festaJ. A fine specimen of adversative asyndeton in pairs (see Intr.
74). The asyndeton is much used by Tacitus, and appears in all its
forms (Intr. 71-75). —non esse . . . ultioneml, “ that our securi-
ty is not a matter of concern with the gods, that our punishment is.'’
This was shown by the terrible slaughters (cladibus) which they had
suffered in the wars of the period. For the double dat„ see H. 390.
4. validum, aegrumJ, i.e. strong or weak in their fidelity to the
Roman government.—casus . . . noscantur-1, “that not merely
the calamities and events may be known, which usually appear for-
tuitouS, but-their reason and causes also,’' i.e. that their dependence
upon antecedent events may be seen. This is the philosophy of his-
tory. The author proposes, then, by way of introduction to his
History, to sum up the elements of the situation and its immediate
antecedents‚ as contributing to the elucidation of subsequent events;
and this he proceeds to do in this and the next few sections, closing
with the eleventh.— evulgato imperii arcanol, “ a new principle
of the empire having been disclosed.'’ Hitherto emperors had been
made only at Rome, but Galba had been made emperor at the head
of his army in Spain. Other armies, then, might make emperors of
