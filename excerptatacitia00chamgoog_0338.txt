and Index, by Gno. Ο. HoLBRooKE, Μ.Α., Professor of Latin in Trinity

“It is evident on every page of this interesting volume that it is t-he
work of a scholar3 and that it belongs to that new school of American
editions which has at last learned to stand on its own legS, and use its own
hrains to some better purpose than merely to decide from whom it is best to
borrow.'’— Professor F. P. Nask, Hobart Codeye, Cenem, N. Y.

“ The Selection from Pliny’s Letters is a pleasant one, and will be
welcomed by many teachers. The choice of letters has been made with
care, and the notes are helpful and pertinent. 1 think that both scholar and
teacher will find the book an interesting and a useful one.”—Prqfessor Jolm
K. Lord, Dartmoutlc Colleye, Hanover, N. H.

“I find the text and notes very satisfactory, and hope to make use of
the book in our course here next year.”—Profissor Minton wama-John

Hopkz’ns University, Baltimore‚ Md.

‘⁴ 1 have examined it with care, and am greatly pleased, not only with
the judgment shown in the selections which are made, but especially with
the full and scholarly character of the notes, The Letters of Pliny are
likely to come more into use in our colleges than heretofore, and Professor
Holbrooke has done good service in >furnishing an edition which seems so
admirable.''—Prqfessor A. G. Hopkins, Hamilton Colleye, Clinton, N. Y.
