mm OF AGRICOLA. 251

(artiora), but with their horses where they were more opem—nec
alius alium respectantes]‚ “nor looking out one for another.’'
They had lost all hope, and each had regard only for himself. — pig-
norum suorum]‚ ie. their wives and children, as in Germ. sec. 7.
What a picture we have here of the indecision, wretchedness, and
despair of this conquered people!—a wretchedness only made the
more conspicuous by the consummate art and power with which the
scene is described—quibus . . . compertuml, “ by whom sent
out into all partS, when it was ascertained that the traces of their
ssight were uncertain, and that the enemy were nowhere collected in
bodies.''

general appearance.’'—metus], “ot' the forbidding,'' “the stern;'’
a partitive gen.—praed.ito]‚ “having been honored with.'' He
was granted the honor of a triumph for his conquesta in Britain
(sec. 40).—fi11a]. She was the wife of Tacitus—nam sicutJ.
Some words like potissimum ficisset seem to have been lost here.—
quod . . . ominibaturl, “ which he anticipated in my hearing by
predictions and wishes.'' —festinatae . . . solatium} This is in
the predicate with tulit—quo Domitianus], i.e. the last part of
his reign. The loss of that part of the author's history which gave
the account of the reign of Domitian is greatly to be deplored; but
in his brief allusions to him he has gibbeted him for all time.

“ as yet (i.e. before the death of Agricola) Carus Metius ‘was judged
of by only a single victory,'' i.e. by a single success in ruining some
public man by prosecuting him before the senate for treason (laesa
majestatis). It was not then known what a miserable informer he
was to become (see Juvenal 1:36).—et intra . . . strepebatl,
“and the accusations of Messalinus were resounding within the
Alban castle,'' i.e. the villa of Domitian at the foot of the Alban
Mount, where he sometimes assembled the senate in a more private
way (see Juv. 4:60-65). Messalinus became one of the vilest of
informem, as Juvenal says of him (4 ε 114); grande et conspicuum
nostro quoque tempore monstrum—Massa Baebiusl. Another
notorious informer after the death of Agricola. At that time, how-
ever, he was himself on trial (reus) for plundering the province of
Baetica, of which he had been governor. He is alluded to Hist. 4 150.
