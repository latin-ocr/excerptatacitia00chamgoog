vi . PREFAOE.

Without neglecting the grammatical ³¹⁶ relations of
the language, something more than the usual atten-
tion has been paid to the thought and its rhetorical
presentation. Tacitus was a profound social and
political philosopher, with a wonderful insight into
the workings of human nature, and a marvellous
power of depicting these workings in sharp senten-
tious language. His thought is deep and subtle, and
his words pointed and few. It is often difficult to
find the thread of his discourse‚ but it is certain to
be golden when found. Indeed, much of the pleas-
ure derived from reading his works arises from the
‚ effort required to ascertain his meaning, which, glim-
mering out from his wonderful wordS, like the light
from a consecrated grove, at once arrests the atten-
tion, but often requires no inconsiderable study and
reflection fully 10 comprehend it. And, while it has
1101 been attempted to deprive the reader of this
pleasure by profuse explanations‚ it has been thought
best here and there to give hints of the meaning and
translate obscure passageS, in order to ensure a clear
understanding of the general scope of the narrative.

In making up the notes, I have been greatly aided

'⁸‘ Grammatical relatione, however, have been chiefly illustrated
by references to parallel passages, and to the introductory essay of
Draeger; but occasional references have been made to Harkness’s
and Madvig's Latin Grammars, and to the grammar of Allen and
Greenough. These are referred to in the notes by the initials of
their authors respectively, the numbers denoting the sections in the
first two, and the pages in the last.
