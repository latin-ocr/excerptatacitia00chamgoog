turb “the former (antea) hateful insolence was desired,'' i.e. the
present state of things being so much worse—quippe . . . indi-
gentl. A sentiment ot* rare truth and beauty. '

his hiding·place, he had been taken to his father’s house in the city
(3: 85).—familiamque]‚ i.e. his family property, slaveS, 8⁵0.—
aetem, i.e. the others engaged in the war for Vespasian.—·000u-
pari redeuntemJ, “should be captured on his way back.'’ This
was to prevent his uniting with other forces and renewing the war.
To accomplish this, forces were sent out towards Tarracina on the
Appian way, the cavalry to Aricia, and the infantry to Bovillae, to
meet him as he approached the city. —seque et eohortesl. See 3:
63. This L. Vitellius was brother of the emperor.—·infelici.a
armaJ, “their unsuccessful arms.”—abstractus], “dragged down,'’
“ruined.”

3. Capuael. This was one of the larger towns in Campania, and
hence its name has an emphatic position at the beginning of the sen·
tence. It was punished for its adherence to the cause of Vitellius by
having a legion quartered on the chief families, while no favor was
shown to Tarracina, although it had suffered much for the Flavian
party (3: 76, 77). Hence the very just sentiment which follows
about returning favors and injuries.—tant0 . . . habeturl, “there
is so much greater inclination to make return for injuries than favors,
because kindness is felt to be a burden‚ revenge a gain.'’ Oneri is
governed by est understood—isdem . . . anulisl. This ring, pre·
sented to him by Vitellius for betraying Tarracina to his* party
(3: 77), was now retained upon his finger in mockery.-cuncta
principibus solitaJ, i.e. all honors and prerogativeS‚ such as the
tribunicial power, the consulship, 8⁵0. -velut expiato terrarum
orbe], “as if the whole world had been purified,” i.e. by this terrible
sacrifice of war, which had been the round (lustraverat) of all the
provinces. The author here looks back to the beginning of the civil
wars at the death of Nero. —ea prima specie formaJ, i.e. as though
the conflict was not yet over, and his fate decided. Vespasian had
not yet arrived at Rome, and his son Titus was engaged in the siege
of Jerusalem.
