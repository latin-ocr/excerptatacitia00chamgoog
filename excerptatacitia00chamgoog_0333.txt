From Princz'pal A. C. anzms, Exeter Academy.

“ We ‘take Bennett’s ‘ First Latin Writer ⁹ as rna an'r MANUAL or LA‘rm

, ὌοΜΡοειΤιοΝ for the first two years of our course. The ‘Easy Latin Sto-

ries ¹ by the same author is excellently fitted for pupils when they are begin-
ning to read Latin.'’

From Dr. H. T. FULLER, St. Johnsbmy Academy.

“ We have used Bennett's ‘First Latin Writer' for the last two yearS,
and find it munan‘rm‘ SA'rrsrAc'rossv. Instead ot' giving detached sentences
to illustrate special grammatical principleS, like most books of the sort, it
takes the pupil over a well-graded series of exercises to the writing of con-
nected discourse. It involves a knowledge of all the principles of Grammar
and Latin Idioms‚ and, by a skilful selection of review work, obliges the
pupil to keep what he has once acquired. Its breadth of vocabulary is com-
mendable in that it is not restricted to the words of any single author.'’

From The N . E. Journal ofEducatz'on

“ In the ‘ Latin Writers ¹ the editor has not sought by a special and limited
vocabulary to assist the pupil in reading one particular author, but has
rather endeavored‚ by a copious vocabulary and gradual but frequent use of
all the rules of Syntax, to give the pupil an excellent foundation for a sound
and comprehensive knowledge of Latin Prose Composition. The exerciseS,
too, are interesting in themselves, and take up th‘e different idiomatic pecul-
iarities in such an easy and natural way, that the pupil almost unconsciously
masters them, without having them glaringly thrust upon him in little
‹letached sentenceS, which, when mixed up in a narrative, he fails of course
to recognize. We cordially recommend these books to the attention of all
classical teachers.''
