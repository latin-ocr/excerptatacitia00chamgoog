The author’s object is to prepare students for the study'and composition ol
Latin Prose‚ by calling their attention first to the peculiarities of English idiom, and
then to the methods of representing the English in the corresponding Latin idiom.
A good deal of space has been given to the Prepositions. The 'Exercises are pur-
posely unarranged‚ as connected examples are useless to test a pupil's knowledge.

 

Abbott’s Latin Prose is the best book of the kind with which 1 am acquainted.
It teaches the student to compose Latin, instead of translating stock sentences.—

Any book by the author of “English Lessons ” and the ‘⁴ Shaksperian Gram-
mar ‘’ Ι should expect to be ood. This seems to me simply admirable, and is quite
as valuable for the study of nglish as for the study of Latin. —Prqfi E. Il. Grtffin

1 feel sure the book will be widely used, as it deals with Latin composition in
the only right way.—Prqf. C. L. Smiclz, Harvard Colleye.

ARISTOPHANES' ACHARNIANS AND KNIGHTS.
The Acharnians and Knights of Aristophanes. Edited by W. C.
Gan-EN, M.A., late Fellow of King's Collega, Cambridge. (Catena
Classicorum.) 12mo, 210 pages. 3120.

The text of this edition is mainly that of Dindorf. In the notes brevitv has
been studied‚ as short notes are more likely to be read, and, therefore, to be useful.
Each play is preceded by an Introduction and an Argument.
