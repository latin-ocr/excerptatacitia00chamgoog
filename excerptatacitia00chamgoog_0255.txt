the last to themselves, and almost fatal to the republic.”

29. Mox . . . rapereturl. Otho had been taken by the preto-
rians to their camp, and declared emperor by them, in place of
Galba. —pro gradibus domus vocatosl, “them called before
the steps of the palace‚’' i.e. he addressed them from tlte steps of the
palace, they standing bejbre them. Pro refers to the position of
those addressed, rather than to that of the speaker, as usual in Taci-
tus (see sec. 36: pro vallo).—caesar adscitus suml, “1 have
been adopted a Caesar.’' Galba had just adopted Piso as his succes·
sor, which was the recognized principle of transmitting the imperial
power at Rome—ut qui . . . discaml, “as one who having
already experienced adversity may very well know ’³ (for the subj.,
see H. 501 ; A. and G. 182, 1). A repetition of discat is implied with

(11. 408).—1.·egionum seditiol. He was addressing the pretorian
cohort which kept guard at the palace, and, to please them, conti-asts
their fidelity with the want of it in the legions which served in the
provinces. Leqionum, therefore, is emphatic, and hence stands first
in its sentence. —transfugae et desertoresl, “runaways and
deserter8‚'' i.e. those who had gone over to Otho and proclaimcd him
emperor.—innocentibus]. Agrees with vobis to be supplied with
pro caede principis (“ to you for the murder of a prince, than to you
innocent ''). Perinde . . . quam (“equally as,'' “the same as '’), a
favorite mode of comparison in Tacitus (see Anu. 1:93 M. 444).
This speech put into the mouth of Piso is calm and dignified, in per-
fect keeping with the character ascribed to him by Tacitus.
