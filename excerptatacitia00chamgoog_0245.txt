Tiberius was a man of splendid physique, and prided himself in tak-
ing care of his own health (valitudines).—officii], i.e. felt of his
pulse in taking his hand to kiss it, as Suetonius says in his Life of
Tiberius. And yet, as the author goes on to say, he did not deceive
him as to his purpose—quasi . . . tribueretl, “as if he would do
honor to his departing friend‚'' i.e. this extra 'feasting was apparently
in honor of his friend, Charicles, about to leave on business (ad
negotia digrediens). Amici here is in the gen. governed by honori,
instead of being in the dat. governed by tribueret (“ for the honor of,’'
instead of ‘⁶ for honor to,’' &c.).- cunqtaJ, i.e. all about his approach.
ing death, as Charicles had announced it to Macro, the successor of
Sejanus as prefect of the pretorian guard, and confidant of Tiberius.
—interolusa . . . explevisseJ, ‘⁶ he was believed to have completed
his mortal course by the ceasing of his breath.” Tacitus is pro-
fuse in his variety in expressing the idea of death. (See A. 1: 3, 5 ;
Η. 1 : 41 ; 4 ε 11). - Caesarl, i.e. Caius Caesar (Caligula), just named,
the expectant successor of Tiberius. - a summa . . . expectabatl,
“from the highest hope was expecting (tearing) the worst,'’ i.e.

as a consequence of his imprudent haste to get possession of the gov-
ernment.

mulis]. See 1: 3, 4.-vacuos principis penatesl, i.e. without
an heir apparent, through the death of the rivals just referred to. -
duodecim annis} The length of time expressed by the abL, in·
stead of the more common acc. Thus quite frequently in Tacitus,
as: ita quatuordecim annis a Nerone assuefactos (H. 1: 4).—mo-
rum . . . ἅνω-83], “there were varying periods in his conduct
and character.'' These periods the author proceeds to state.

This is a fitting close to the sketch of the character of Tiberius,
which is brought out with masterly touches, here and there, through
the whole course of these first six books of the Annals.
