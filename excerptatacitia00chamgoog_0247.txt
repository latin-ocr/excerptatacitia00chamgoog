Boon xv] Annius. 195,

39. Qua . . . continuaveratl, “by which he had joined the pal·
ace and the gardens of Maecenas. The imperial palace was built by
Augustus on the Palatine Hiu, and the gardens or park of Maecenas
lay to the east, in the Esquiline plain, to which Nero had extended
it.—cecinisse], “sang,'' “enacted,'’ i.e. as in opera. Nero was a
famous singer and performer at the theatres (see 13 : 3 ; 15: 33 and
48).

40. Quia proruperat], “because it had broken forth from the
Aemilian estates of Tigellinus '' (“ loco ad Campum Martium extra
urbem,'' Orel.). Tigellium, prefect of the pretorian guard, was
the odious instrument of Nero in his vices and persecutions (H. 1:
72), and was suspected, probably, of having kindled the fire, in sym-
pathy with Nero, who wished to build a new city for his own glory.

41. Multa seniores meminerintJ, ⁸⁸ id est, facile meminisse pos-
sunt '⁹ (Orel.). These treasures of learning and works of art could
not be replaced, in however great beauty <quamvis in tanta pulchri-
tudine) the city might be rebuilt. Tacitus fully realized the great-
ness of the loss.

42. Solita . . . vulgata], “being long before customary and
used in luxury,’' i.e. gems and gold. There were many of these,
indeed, in his palace3 but they did not equal (perinde . . . quam)
the landscape ornaments of lawnS, pools, &c., around it. This was
called Nero's golden palace.— gignendis aquisJ. The Pomptino
Marshes were to furnish the supply of water to this impracticable
canaL

43. Ceterum . . a supererant1, ‘⁸ but what of the city remained
after his house,” i.e. besides the space occupied by Nero's palace.
-nulla . . . erecta]. The whole space was not covered with build-
ings3 but, as the author goes on to say, the blocks of buildings (vici)
were distinct from each other, and the streets were widened, 8⁶0.—
msularumJ. These were tenement houses, which were now to have
a porch or covered walk in front, built at the expense of the em-
peror.—ruderi accipiendol, “for receiving the filth.'' This, it
appears, was sent from the city by boats to the marshes at the mouth
of the Tiber. —certa sui partel, ‘⁶ in a certain part of them.’' The
Gabian stone was found at Praeneste. —jam . . . ambirenturl.
Private individuals were no longer allowed the unrestrained use of
water 3 but a board (custodes) was appointed to see that there was a
good public supply, and that private families had conveniences (sub-
sidia) for extinguishing fires; also that there were proper division·
walls in their houses, between themselves and their neighbors.
