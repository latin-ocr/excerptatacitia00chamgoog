of the soldiers‚ they were disposed to discuss rather than obey the
commauds of their leaders (Tyler). Mallet is subj. after qui, as
expressing the result (yet, so that they, &c.).—pessimum . . . fao·
tum est). What they actually undertook to do was the worst which
they could have done, viz. to proceed on a march of sixteen miles to
take possession of the junction of the Adda and the Po (just south
of the camp of the enemy, at Cremona), and this, too, heavy with
baggage, and sure to be attaeked before they could reach it and
encamp there, by the fresh troops of Vitellius. Notwithstanding the
objections of Celsus and Paulinus, however, they were proceeding
towards that point (petebant), when, by a despatch from Otho, the
battle was brought on at a bridge opposite Brixellum, at an island in
the Po (sec. 33-35), which, according to Heraeus, was about four

much employed for couriers. Sane (indeed) implies that the views
of Celsus and Paulinus corresponded with those of Otho.

the battle must have been near this. -exploratores . . . nuntia·

probably a ruse, though the author says it was doubtful what their
object was. —ordine agminis). This was different from the order
of battle. - a paucioribus . . . impingerentur]‚ “ that by a smaller

The Vitellian horsemen had dashed forth before their time, and were
badly repulsed by a smaller number of Othonian horsemen (see 3: 2).

These were evidently ditches by the sides of the road (32 21).
Hence they were confined within the narrow limits of the rond-bed.
