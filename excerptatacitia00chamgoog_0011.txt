PREFAon

⁸——

ΤΗΕ design of this book is to give a somewhat'
comprehensive view of the writings of Tacitus in a
comparatively small space. For this purpose, por-
tions have been taken from all his‘works‚ except the
Germania, not, however, without some regard to
unity in the main parts. Most of the extracts from
the Annals relate to that most interesting of Roman
princeS‚ Germanicus; while the extracts from the
History are very largely connected with the move-
ment which resulted in the accession of Vespasian to
the principate of Rome. These great charactere, and
that of Agricola, naturally excited the admiration of
Tacitus, and inspired his narrative, even when bear-
ing but remotely upon them, with extraordinary life
and vigor. Much of this narrative, it is true, is
omitted here3 but the information required by these
omissions has been supplied in the notes. And, in
general, all biographical and historical information
which seemed to be required has been introduced

into the notes.
