Gaul, whither they sent letters to stir them up to revolt from
Vitellius.

87. urbem . . . petebat} The author now turns to Vitellius,
who, flushed with the victory over Otho at Bedriacum, was slowly
moving from the Po to take possession of Rome, and growing more
contemptible at every step, by halting at all the pleasant places on
the route to gratify his sels-indulgent and indolent spirit. This de-
scription of parallel movements in different parts of the empire is a
marked feature in the history of Tacitus. The great extent of the
empire, and the various and widely separated centres of influence,-
as numerous as the different armies, —made st necessary for him, in
order to keep all things abreast, to turn from one to the other. This
gives breadth, variety, and attractiveness to his picture. —lixarum].
As lixae (“market men ”) and calones (“baggage carriers’') belong
to the same general class of men and are usually found together (see
1: 49; 3: 20), lixarum here takes the place of calonum, found in the
previous sentence-flagitiosa per obsequial, “by shameful ser-
vices.'' Notice the anastrophe of the preposition (per).—qu.ibus
dehonestamentisL “ in which dishonors of friendship,'’ i.e. in which
dishonorable friendships.

89. A. ponte Mulviol. A bridge across the Tiber, about two
miles from Rome, on the Flaminian way, the great northern road.
From this point, though himself disposed to proceed in full military
dress, Vitellius, at the instance of his friends, assumed the dress of
a civilian (praetexta), that he might not seem to enter the city as a
conqueror. -totidemque . . . vexillari, “and the same number of
detachments from other legions on their flanks” (circa, “around,''
“on both sides;'’ see Ann. 4: 74).-equesl, sing. for the plural
(Intr. 3). The equites were Roman horsemen in the rear of the in-
fantry, with squads of auxiliary horsemen (alae) for wings (see
Dic. Antiq.).—cohortesl, i.e. auxiliary troopS, made up of different
nationalities‚ as appears.— praefecti, tribuni. primi centurio·
numl. In modern phrase these were: quartermasters, colonels, and
captains. —non vitellio . . . exercitusl, “an army worthy not of
such a prince as Vitellius.”

90. AlteriusL for alius, i.e. as if of a foreign state, where he was
not known. For the distinction between alter and alius, see M. 496.
