logical Analysis of ⁴the Apology, by W. WAGRER, Ph.D. Revised
Edition. 16m0, 145 pagae. 90 ets. -

The text of this edition is based on that of the Bodleian MS„ and is claimed to
be the most correct text extant. Throughout the work, the editor‘s aim has been
to be as brief-and concise as possible, not attempting originality, but carefully using
and arranging the materials amassed by preceding commentatore. In the revised
edition, some references to parallel passages have been omitted, and extended refer-
ences to American grammars have been added.

The text has been prepared with great care, and the print is excellent. . . .
The notes show much thought and discrimination. They are apt and terse, and
just such as a student needs; the grammatical references to Hadley and Goodwin

‘reginis edssion a preference over others.—Pr0s. F. W. T nstin, Univeraty at
ewa ry, a.

1 am glad von have republished the book, which, 1 think, will be useful in
this countrv. The work, like others of WVagner, abounds in ori ‘nal and sensible
remarks; the notes are to the point, and tersely expressed.— rqs'. F. D. Allen,
University qs Cincinnati, 01:50.

1 confidently recommend it to the favorable consideration of all students. lt
is eminently scholarly without any parade of scholarship, and gives all the requisito

information without removing from the student the necessity for using his own
brains.—Prqf. Il. Wkitehmme, Union Colleye, Schenectady.

This edition enters especially into the critical and grammatical explanation of

least of all to collect the doctrines and tenets of later philosophers aud thinkers on
the subjecta treated by Plato.

1 have now in use, with my higher classes, your edition of the Phaedo of Plato,
and find it altogether satisfactory. It shows much greater care and scholarslag

than are usually found in college text-books.—Prqlessor Ch. Moe-ris, Rundo
Macen Colleye, Viryinia.

The edition of Plato’s Phaedo, by Wagner, is one of rare excellence. Seldom,
tf ever, has there been so much of value m a text-book compressed 1n so small a
space. —Prqfeesor J. prer, Rutym Cocle9e‚ New Jersey.
