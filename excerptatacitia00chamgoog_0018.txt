§ 14. Of voice in verbs.

(a) We find in Tacitus a persona] passive of the intransitive
verbs dubitare, triumphare, ministrare, regnare. -

(b) Coepi in the active with a passive infin.: 38, audiri, dimna
veri, eligi, occidi. In the strictly classical writers„ the passive forms
of coepi are used with such infinitives, but not in Tacitus.

ἓ 15. Of the T enses.

(α) The Perfect for the Pluperfect; scripsit (Ann. 1: 53), trans-
tulit (Ann. 2: 62), thus often. So, a1s⁰‚ not unfrequently in Caesar.
In such caseS, the act is timed from the present, rather than from
some past act to which it might be referred.

’ (b) The Pluperfect for the Perfect: aboleverat (Anu. 2: 5), ad-
vexerat (Ann. 1: 63), and thus often3 s0‚ a1s0‚ in Sallust and Livy.
Here the act is specially timed with reference to some previous act.

(c) The subjunctive of the Present and Perfect in indirect dis-
course about the past is not unfrequently found in the History and
Annals of Tacitus, 38, 3180, in Caesar and Livy, less frequently in
Sallust. This seems to arise from a desire for variety in the form of
the verbal endings.

ξ 16. Moods. An innovation sometimes found in Tacitus, and oc·
casionally, a1s0‚ in the later writers, is the use of the Perfect sub-
junctive as a potential present or imperfect in subordinate sentences ,· while,
in the earlier writers (and generally, too, in Tacitus), this use was
allowed only in principat or independent sentences: ut ita dixerim
(Agr. 3), ut sic dixerim (Dial. 34 ). The use of the moods by Tacitus
in principal sentences is entirely correct.

IL SIMPLE SENTENCES.

A. AGREEMENT.

ξ 17. Ayreement in number. Collective nouns and pronouns often
have a plural predicate: seditiosissimum quemque vinctos trahunt.
