cives et deos ipsos precor 3 atrox, avidum et societati impatiens.
This is avoided in writers of the classical period, except when the
two members connected by et are vicwed as one.

Et is found, als0, as a connective in negative sentences: non proe-
lium et acies parantur3 non satis expolitus et splendens ; nihil us-
quam prisci et integri moris; non vox et mutui hortatus juvabant.
In earlier writers nec, aza, ac, or que was used in such caseS.

Et (“ also ''), not used in this sense in Caesar, and very sparingly
in Cicer0‚ is common in Livy, and a favorite with Tacitus and the
writers of his time. For the sake of euphony jam et was always used
instead of jam etiam.

found also in Sallust, Livy, VelleiuS, and Curtius, but not in Cicer0‚

times, viz„ H. 3: 633 Ann. 4: 3 and 34: opibusque atque honoribus.
