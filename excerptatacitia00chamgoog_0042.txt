26 LANGUAGE ΑΜ) STYLE 013· TAcrrns.

urbem extra, hostem propter, humum super, oceano abusque. In
this case, the preposition is always of two syllables. So occasionally in
Cicero, Livy, and Suetonius.

(b) Between two co-ordinate nouns: «Iudaeam inter Suriamque,
tumulos super et recentia caede vestigia, viam inter Mosellamque
flumen, Misenum apud et Ravennam, Tarsam inter et Turesim, and
thus often with inter. Here, t00‚ the preposition is of two syllables.
Found occasionally in Caesar and Livy.

(c) Between a noun and its attribute which follows it: judice ab
uno (Ann. 3: 10); partem in aliam (11 : 3) ; lacu in ipso—urbe ex ipsa
(122 56). And so often with ipse. This usage was originally poetic,
as in Virg. Aen. 3: 348, but adopted by Livy.

(d) Between two nouns in apposition: oppido a Canopo, montem
apud Erycum, Arcade ab Evandro, Ferentino in oppido. This is a
poetic usage.

(e) Between a noun and a yenitive depending upon it: ornatum ad
urbis, initio ab Suriae, sedes inter vestalium, ripam apud Euphratis,
paucos inter senum regum. This is poetic also.

(s) After two coordinate nouus .· Amisiam et Lupiam amnes inter,
dis et patria coram, Laodicenis ac Magnetibus simul. First used by
Virgil.

These six forms of anastrophe, with the exception of No. b, occur
only in the Annals.

ξ 117. Tacitus by anastrophe often gives conjunctiores a post-posi-
tion, instead of their usual one bejbre the word or at the beginning of
the sentence which they connect ; viz„ namque, quippe, quanquam,
quin etiam, immo, quin immo, siquidem, dum, donec, ut, quasi,
quum—The later writers abound in this more, but there are ex-
amples of it also in the classical period. Thus we find ut as the
seventh word in its sentence, and quum as the ninth word even
in Cicero.

ἓ 118. Order qf sentences and structure of periods. Although the
relation of the subordinate sentences to the principal sentence is

generally correct, yet occasionally his style is rendered heavy by an
accumulation of subordinate clauses after the principa] sentence:
aS, insignis fide, et amisso per vulnus oculo, paucis ante anniS, duce
Tiberio (Ann. 2: 9); legionarios obtrivit, uno tantum centurione
turrim, in qua praesidium agebat, defendere auso, factaque saepius

eruptione, et caesis qui—suggrediebantur, donec —subveniretur
(15:12). The like also in Ann. 15: 45, 2:21311. 2: 11.
