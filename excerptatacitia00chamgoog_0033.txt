lv. SUBORDINATE SENTENCES.

A. Sunsmnrwn Snnrnucns.

ἓ 76. Sentences with ut (that) are found in Tacitus depending
upon: sino, perpetro, posco, opus est, sufficit, expedit, spes, jubeo,
subigo, opperior3 all which are unclassical.

ἓ 77. Ne (that not) is used as follows: quae causa fuit ne, etc.
(Anu. 3: 38 ; in Livy 5: 55, causa ut), quos ne nominatim tradam,
majoribus eorum tribuendum puto (Anu. 14: 11); perpetro ne, etc.
(Ann. 14: 11); enisus ne (Anu. 14: 28).

ἓ 78. The subjunctive without ut or ne .- feriret hortabantur ; orabant
puniret noxios3 postulat coiretur. These cases are regular, but the
bare subj. after pepiyere and jubere are new with Tacitus (the last is
found, however, in the classical poets). · 7

ἓ 79. The bare in finitive after esse (est videre3 conjectare erat, like
the Greek). After: dari, negotium dare, certare, flagitare, cupido
est, cura est, ratio est, nec deerat, contingit, mereri, niti, adniti, am-
plecti, incumbere, impellere, perpellere, subigere, adigere, arcere,
instare, consentire, componere, orare, scribere, monere, admonere,
hortari, cohortari, suadere, persuadere, praecipere, imperare, man-
dare, praescribere, nuntiare, denuntiare, optare, inducere, illicere,
aemulari, deposcere, exposcere, dubitare, pangere, ambire, tem-
perare.

The above cases, usually found in writers of the classical period
with utor some other construction instead of the simple infin„ are
characteristic of the later writers and those of the silver age of the
language. But the infin. construction after: aemulor, compone, illi-
cio, induco, pang0, perpe110, scribo, is found only in Tacitus.

§ 80. The accusative with the infinitive also has in Tacitus a wider
use than in earlier writers, and is found after: impetrare, illacrimare,
obstitit, adnectare (each of these four but once), orare, expostulare,
gratari, suadere, cordi esse, perferre, permittere, prohibere, recusare,
offensus. Also after the verbs of accusiny: accusare, incusare, urgere
(each of the three but once), coarguere (Cic. insimulare), and the
negative expressions implying doubt .· haud dubium est, nec dubium
