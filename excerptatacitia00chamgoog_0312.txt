i.e. the gift of oratory. With all their resources, even such men
could not get along without the aid of the orators. —togatorum],
i.e. of men in public, and not at horne in their tunics. When the
orator appeared in the court or in the forum, the concourse was
greater even than when surrounded by his clients at home—in
unuml, i.e. the orator.— accipere . . . induerit]‚ “to receive
whatever state of mind the orator has induced.’' —et imperitorum

. . exposita], “are open to the eyes even of those who have
never experienced them.’'—-quoddam}. This agrees with pondus.
—curaml‚ i.e. an oration.—nam . . . nascunturl. We see the
true Tacitian subtlety and genius here.

21. et exsurgit . . . commendatl, “ and swells into ridgeS, and
ruddiness covers the very sinews, and comeliness commends them.''
A very apt and beautiful comparison.—nolo . . . sufficeretl, “1
am unwilling to censure Corvinus, because neither by his own fault
did he fail (per ipsum stetit) to express the elegance and splendor
of our timeS, and because we see how much his soree of mind or
genius supplied in a trial.'’ Corvinus was a distinguished orator and
consul in the time of Augustus (Ann. 13:34). Nec is here correla-

(Doed.) — excessusl, ie. the close, or peroration. —referreL ‘⁴ to
carry away.”—non eo . . . tegil. In its application to the orator,
this covering must be his language and style. A most apt and
elegant comparison again. ——Variet compositionem]. Tacitus,
more than any other author, aims at this in all his writings.

31. Quae . . . numerantufl, i.e. what is morally indifferent in
character, as for instance the facts of science. The sources of true
oratory are admirably described here. —tenebit venas animoruml,
‘⁴ he will hold the keys (venas) of their feelings.'' The veins being
internal and permeating the whole body denote its interior or essen-
tial nature. -aptos . . . locosl, i.e. the points or sources of-argu-
