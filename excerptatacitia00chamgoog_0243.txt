33. consociataJ, “ compacted,” i.e. a limited democracy, made
up of popular and aristocratic elementa is ideally the best, but
scarcely practicable. -plebe vandal, “when the common people
had the power.’' The abl. absolute is often equal to cum with a
finite construction. (Intr. 110; A. 8⁵ G. 142, b„ note). It is used here
for variety, as the following clause has the construction with cum.
The plebs were the lower classes, without full political rights, and the
melyas the mass of common or vulqar people3 while the populus in·
cluded in a general way all classes, but specifically the more respect-
able classes below the knights, senatore, and nobles. — temperanter
habereturJ, “might be governed with moderation.'' To do this
required a knowledge of the common people,—neque alia . .
imperitetl, “nor the Roman state being other than if a king
reigned.” They were under the nominal governinent of the senate,
directed by a prince (Tiberius); but the prince was really absolute
ruler. ——in rem fuerit1, “it will have been useful,'' i.e. to relate the

would think, therefore, that they were aimed at, although not at all
telated to the persons censured. -ut nimis . . . arguensL “as too
sharply implying the contrary.” Hence it awakened their hostility.
-eed . . . redeo} This interesting account of his Annals is an
apologetic digression from the mass of dry materials which he found
himself confined to in the reign of such a prince as Tiberius.

67. Dedicatis . . . templiel. Some time during the previous
year (Am. 26), Tiberius had left Rome to dedicate temples to Jupi-
ter in Capua, and to Augustus at Nola, in Campania (sec. 57). His

ι neal motive‚ as Tacitus thinks, was to gratiiy his cruelty and lust

at a distance from Rome. The tyrannical and cruel acts of his gov-
ernment could thus be charged upon the agents which he employed
to execute thern. In pnrsuance of the same misanthnopical purpose.
he now removes to the leland of Capreae, a still more remote and .
