The Christiana, as having sprung from the Jews, and with them

recognizing an invisible King higher than Caesar, shared with them
also the hatred of the Roman8,— as seen here, and also in the fifth
book of our author's history, where he gives an account of the origin
and customs of the Jews. They were just the subjects for such a
wretch as Nero to select to bear the odium of having burned the
city, in order to divert it from himself.—aut crucibus . . . ure-
rentur]‚ “ or nailed to crosses‚ or reserved for the flames, and that
as soon as daylight had disappeared they should be burned as noc·
turnal torches.’' What refinement of cruelty on innocent persons,

punishments,'’ i.e. although viewed thus by the people. Tacitus
evidently did not believe in their guilt, although he shared in the
pre judices of the people against them.
