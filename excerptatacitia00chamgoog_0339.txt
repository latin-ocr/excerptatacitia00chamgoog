‘⁴ 1 consider the Selections to be an excellent and long-needed book. 1
shall use it more or less every term from the beginning of Freshman year.
For reading at sight it is just the thing that I have wanted, and, in connection
with the'study of the development of Roman Literature, such a book will be
highly interesting and profitable. Ι have always maintained that it is a flat,
stale, and unprofitable task for the student to read about the productioris of
Latin authore, without at the same time studying the productione them-
selves.’' —Prqfessor Clearles Chandler, Deuison University, Granville, Olu'o.

“ The Latin Selecte‘ons I have examined with care from beginning to end,
and am marvellously plcased with it. For the purposes suggested in the
author's preface, 1 think it is by far the best thing published.'’—Prqfessor
W. B. Gmmison, Se. Lawrenoe University‚ Canum, N. Y.

“The Selectae‘ons have been made with discretiori, not only in that they
are interesting in themselves, but in that they are such as to show the pecu-
liarities of the thought and style of the several writers. The book cannot fail
to be useful as a manual of exercises for translation at sight, and also as a
text-book in connect-ion with instruction in the history of Latin literature.'’
—Prqsessor J. H. Hewitt, Williams Colleye, Williamstown, Mass.

“ The plan seems to me to be carried out with excellent judgment and
taste. This work certainly gives in succinet and attractive form aclear

view of Roman literature throughout its best periods.”—Prqsessor T racy
Peck, Yale calleyo, New Haven, Conn.

“It will be of 'great service in courses in Roman literature. containing
much that was not easily accessible before.'' — Prqfhssor W. F. Allen, State
University, M adison, Wisc01131·n.

“A volume which will be of great service in teaching the Latin lan-
guage and Roman literature. both of which find here abundant illustratione,
chronologically arranged-’¹ — T lze Nate'on, New York. .
