but common in his other writings: as, hastas, saxa et faces; socios,
cives et deos ipsos precor: atrox, avidum et societati impatiens.
This is avoided in writers of the classical period, except when the
two members connected by et are viewed as one.

Et is found, also, as a connective in negative sentences: non proe-
lium et acies parantur: non satis expolitus et splendens 3 nihil us-
quam prisci et integri moris: non vox et mutui hortatus juvabant.
In earlier writers nec, aut, ac, or que was used in such cases.

Et (“ also '’)‚ not used in this sense in Caesar, and very sparingly
in Cicero, is common in Livy, and a favorite with Tacitus and the
writers of his time. For the sake of euphony jam et was always used
instead of jam etiam.

ἓ 62. Et instead of quum after the words with a temporal meaning.
interim, nondum, necdum, jam, simul. In this, writers after Livy
imitated Virgil.

§ 63. The copulative particles que, et, ac, atque are used interchanqe-
ably m the History and Annals: ae, Vulcano et Cereri Proserpinaeque, ·
Tiberii Caiique et Claudii ac Neronis; Pharasmani Polemonique et
Aristobulo atque Antiocho, tetrarchis ac regibus praefectisque et
procuratoribus.

§ 64. Other peculiarities‚ occurring very rarely and only m his
larger works, are: et alii instead of alii-alii 3 necdum instead of non·
dum3 et quoque (used since the time ot Livy) and quoque non.

(b) Connssm'nvn Coronam-tvae.

5 65. Instead of the regular correlative copulatives σιτ-α (both
and, so well as also), we find occasionally the following:

(a) que-que, but only in the Annals. Exceptions in the classical
writers and Livy, these are never found in Caesar and Suetonius.

(b) que-et.- aS, Agr. 18, H. 4: 2, 42, and eight times in the Annals3
found also in Sallust, Livy, Velleius, and Curtius, but not in Cicer0,
Caesar, Suetonius, Nep08, FloruS‚ and Justin. In such cases que is
always joined to se, sibi, or ipse in TacituS‚ but with a noun in Livy.

(c) que-ac (atque) only in his larger works, and there only three
times, viz„ H. 3 ; 63 ; Ann. 4: 3 and 34: opibusque atque honoribus.
This does not occur in classical prose, and only once in Ovid, Livy,
and Curtius.

5 66. Ne-quidem for emphasis instead of neque.- Germ. 7, 37, 44 ;
H. 2: 823 Ann. l : 4: prima ab infantia -ne iis quidem annis. Found
only in Tacitus.
