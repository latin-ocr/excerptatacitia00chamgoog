87. Utriusque principisL i.e. Otho and Vitellium—in ludium
consultare], “should consult together,” i.e. to agree on some suit·
able man for emperor. -- spatium1, “a pause.”—praecipua spe
PauliniJ, “with special hope on the part of PaulinuS,'' i.e. that he
would be selected for emperor.-ut concesseriml, “as 1 would
allow.'' For the perf. subj. as a potential mood in subordinate
sentences, see Intr. 16. — qua prudentia fuit], “ with what wisdom
there was to him,'' “wise as he was.’' Hence he could not believe
that he entertained such a project.—1egatos]. Leyatus means a
deputy‚ either civil or military. A leqacus consularis was a lieutenant
or military governor of a province, generally with subordinate lieu-
tenants under him—nisi . . . suisJ, “unless corrupted and laid
under obligation to them by their services.'’

38. Securae . . . tuith “there was leisure to aspire to secure

in dominationeml, “into a despotism’' (see Ann- 1: 1).—quae-

at supremacy, just as much as did Julius and Augustus Caesar, who
crushed them.—eadem]‚ i.e. tlte same which operated in the pre·
viously named cases. —- quod . . . factum est1, “ that wars have been
despatched by single bloWS, as it were, has arisen from the cowardice
(inefficiency) of the princes,’' —referring, it would seem, particularly
to such princes as Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, who successively suc-
cumbed after a brief contest. The author shows here his usual
admirable insight into men and governments.

39. Visae . . . praefectuml. By the departure of Otho, the
chief command of the army devolved upon his brother3 but the real
power and authority was with the prefect of the pretorians, who were
the original and chief supporters of the Othonian movement for the
principate (12 36, 87). This left Celsus and Paulinus with but the
