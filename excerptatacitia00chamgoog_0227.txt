Boon 1.1 armins. 175

“as a guide to the youth (i.e. Drusus), and to show to the others the
dangers and rewardS,'’ i.e. to show to the Pannonian soldiers the
dangers of their rebellious course, and the rewards which would
attend obedience. This Sejanus was the evil genius of Tiberius.
He was the only person whom the emperor had confidence in, which
confidence he abused in the most flagitious manner. For the post-
classical word, ostentator, see Intr. 4. -ἰιιείςιύῢιιεη, de omnis generis
ornamentis, non de aquilis solis (Doed.). On festive occasions, the
Roman soldiers were accustomed to furbish up and anoint their
armor‚ standards, and other military trappings; the neglect. of this
was a token of distress, as at the funeral of Germanicus ( see Ann.
3: 2).

25. Et repentel, “ and then suddenly.’' Et connecting the third
member of a series is very common in the Annals (see Intr. 61).—
pavebant terrebantquel. “they feared and inspired fear.” We
have here a striking word-picture, drawn in outline by a few bold
strokes. Notice the grave solemnity of the passage, and how the
effect is heightened by the omission of conjunctions, auxiliary verba,
and all unnecessary words—quibuscum . . . toleravisset} Tibe·
rius had served in Pannonia during his first consulship. — apud pa-
tresl, “before the fathers‚’' i.e. in the senate—quem . . . caseth
“which ought (par esset) to be kept. without participation in (exper-
tem) neither the favor nor the severity.'’ i.e. the senate should be
consulted, and decide whether their request should be granted or
refused, and thus share in the favor or odium of the decision.

26. Quae persennia, “what he should present.'' The conditions
which he proceeds to present are the same as those named in sec. 17.
As the relative implies ea (“ such as ''), the subjunctive is used (H. 501).
—cum =. . . obtenderetl, “ when he interposed the will of the senate
and of his father.’' The imperf. subj. here, as usual, with cum in a
temporal sense, follows an historical pres. in the principal clause
(H. 518, II.).—nunquam nisi ad sel, “nowhere except to them-

. selves,'' i.e. were they to have all the boy-commanders of the royal

family, as they had formerly had Tiberius and now Drusus? Such
could never decide any thing for themselves.

27. manus . . . armoruml, “ shaking their fists at them, as the
cause of their discord and appeal to arms.'’ The apposition (causam,
etc.) explaining the preceding act, is of the nature of an attribute
(see Intr. 47). —illa militiae flagitia]‚ “those abuses of the military
service,'' i.e. such insubordination as existed there at that time.
