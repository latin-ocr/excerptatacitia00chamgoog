Boon 114 HISTORY. 221

— astrepebatJ. A favorite word with Tacitus for expressing blind,
unmeaning applause (see astrepebat vulqus, Ann. 1: 18), probably
from the correspondence of the sound to the sense, like our obstrep-
erous.—frustra], ‘¹ i.e. sine causa, cum exitium ei immineret ”
(Heraeus).

93. PrincipiaJ, “ head -quarterS,’' i.e. at the pretorian cumps, just ·=
outside of the city walls—infamibus locis} The region of the
Mons Vaticanus, across the Tiber, has always been notorious for its
unhealthiness. The adjective here is an instance of the metaphorical.
use of words which so enlivens the style of Tacitus (see Intr. 122, i).
—fluminis aviditaSJ, i.e. the desire of drinking and bathing in it.—
00nfusus . . . militiaeJ, “ the order of military service was disturbed
by perverseness or ambitious views,'' i.e. on the part of Vitellius and
Valens, as described in what follows in this section and the next, viz„
in levying sixteen pretorian cohortS, instead of the regular number of
nine, and four city cohorts, instead of the former number of three
(see Ann. 14), and weakening his German legions by allowing their
members to enlist in these cohorts for the more desirable city ser-
vice, while he ruined the pretorians by the introduction of such a
mob of new soldiers. The old 'pretorian cohorts which had been in
the service of Otho had been disbanded by Vitellius (sec. 67 ).—
plus . . . exemissetl, “ Valens took more upon himself in that
levy on the assumption (tanquam) that he had rescued Caecina him-
self from danger,'’ i.e. at the battle of Bedriacum (40-42).-et
sinistrum . . . vertebatJ, “and he had changed the unfavorable
rumor of a tardy journey to a prosperous battle.” He was much
later in reaching the Po than Caecina.—Pluitassel‚ “to have
wavered.” Caecina soon betrayed his party (32 13).

94. convulsum . . . electisl, “ the honor of the camp (i.e. of
the pretorians> was destroyed by the inmixing rather than the
electing of twenty thousand from the whole army,'’ i.e. the sixteen
pretorian and four city cohorts of 1,000 men each, made up as above
described.
