(i.e. of the Saturnalia, sec. 78). We have in this section a fine
specimen of the cumulative method of the author in picturing a
scene which he wished to work up to its true height. He adds touch
to touch, with a sort of riot of cumulative circumstances, till every
feature of the scene is completely brought out!

Rome on the Appian way, was the head-quarters of the Vitellian
