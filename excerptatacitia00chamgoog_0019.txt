i mTRonth'rmN. ‘ 5

So, also, uterque, pars, multitudo, plebes, vulgus, exercitus, manus,
vexillum, juventus. This construction is very common in Livy, but
'very rare in Cicero,

ἓ 18. Ayreement in yender.

(a) AdJectives and pronouns are often in the neuter instead of the
masculine or feminine: comitatem et temperantiam, nulli invisa
(Arm. 11: 16). T-his is most common with the neuter of the demon-
strative pronoun: aS, non medicinam illud, sed cladem appellans
(Ann. 1 ε 49), quasi illud respublica esset (Ann. 4: 19); non enim pre-
ces sunt istud (Ann. 2: 38). We find the same construction in Sallust.

(b) In the masculine instead of the neuter. This, however, is
'found mostly in connection with milia. The following from Anu,
11: 25 is wholl'y unprecedented: judicium 'censorum ac pudor sponte
cedentium permixti (instead of permixta).

B. InrnnnooAmvn Sem-nuens.

Α ξ 19. We find a question in a final sentence only once in Tacitus
(Anu. 14: 43) z decernite impunitatem, ut quem dignitas sua defendat.
This Greek construction is found but three times in Cicero, and five
times in Livy. The participial sentence never takes au interrogative
form in Tacitus, ’

as in Ann: 1: 9, 35, 65, and often. (2) Without a following subs
junctive only in a very few cases. (3) In indirect questions and in
exclamationS, as in Ann. 1: 11, 16, 48, and often. (4) After tanquam
and dum in indirect discourse‚ as in Germ. 39, and Ann. 6: 26. This
is very rare in early writers.
⁷ (c) In the Infinitive: Hist. 4: 23, neque id malorum (scil. Jbre);
Ann. 1: 15, subsidium (Jbre); 2: 31, petiturum se vitam (fuisse). So
