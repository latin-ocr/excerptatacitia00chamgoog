mernonucnon. 27

The structure of the histor-icat period is often injured by the use of
the co·ordinate instead of the subordinate arrangement of the clauseS,
often by a geni-al freedom of arrangement, and also by arranging his
matter after the form used by the old historical writers. He employs
very commonly that simplest of arrangementS, where a sinqle subor-
dinate sentence precedes the principal sentence ; as, quod postquam
Corbuloni cognitum est, ire praefectum— jubet (Anu. 13: 9). Very
’ common also is that arrangement, so usual with Livy, the participle,
the subordinate sentence, and then the pn‘ncipal sentence; as, interea
manipuli— missi, postquam turbatum in castris accepere, vexilla con-
vellunt. Very rarely two subordinate sentences not connected by a co-
ordinate conjunction precede the principal sentence: as, ubi ventum ad
aggerem, dum missilibus certabatur, plus vulnerum in nos et plerae-
que caedes oriebantur (Ann. 12: 35); also 1 ε 35 ; H. 1 : 22. This last
arrangement of sentences is not found in the older writers.

Tacitus only occasionally forms a complicated period, beginning

with an alternation of conjunctive sentences and participles, to
which the principal sentence, sometimes with a second succession of
subordinate sentences, succeeds, so that one is reminded of Livy in
the overburdened structure. The period in the second section of
the first book of the Annals is something after this sort. Su, also,
1: 6, quod postquam, etc. Here several subordinate sentences, with
an intervening parenthesis, precede; then follows the principal sen-
tence,—monuit Liviam‚—and then six more subordinate sentences.
Other complicated periods occur in Ann. 133 54, illic per otium, etc.;

(ὶ- ἓ 119. Disreqard of concinnity. While the classical writers sought
to secure the perspicuity and harmony of their style by a uniform
construction of ‹zo-ordinate or corresponding clauseS, Tacitus, in
which he had been in some measure preceded by Livy, departed
from their rules in many ways, often intentionally, and, as it seems,
from disgust at the prescribed form of the schools. In place of this
earlier uniformity, we find, especially in his larger works, a purposed
variety, where the author exchanges for each other in different
parts of a sentence or period :
