brother of his cousin Drusus, and is often spoken of as such, and as
son of his uncle Tiberius. —abolendae magis infamiael. A gen.
with the gerundivo, seeming to imply causa for its government‚ but
regarded by Draeger as a causal yen. 3 a usage borrowed from the
Greek (Intr. 108).— dignum ob premiumJ. This displacement of
the preposition is very common in Tacitus, and is call'ed anastrophe
(Intr. 116).—juniores]. These were persons between the ages of
eighteen and forty-six (also called, juvenes and adolescentes); while
those between forty-six and sixty were called seniores or veteres.
Boys also were called pueri minores when under fourteen, and pueri
majores when between fourteen and eighteen years of age. — quotus
quisqueJ, “how few individuals.’'

4. Moris} The partitive gen. is much used by Tacitus, whether
depending upon pronounS, nounS, or the substantive verb esse‚· and
‘moris especially is thus used by him, as: malique moris, sec. 33; ut

times, the Claudii were noted for their pride and contempt for the
common people. The emperor's full name was Tiberius Claudius
Nera—indicia saevitiael. Tiberius was distinguished for his sul-
len secretiveness and cruelty. His retiring to Rhodes (for eight
years) before his accession to the principate, and to Campania and
'the island of Capriae during the last eleven years of his reign, was in
consequence of his dark, misanthropic, and moody disposition.— femi-
nae duobusque insuper adolescentibusl, i.e. Livia, the mother
of Tiberius (“of feminine violence,’' muliebri impotentia), and Drusus,
the son of Tiberius, and his adopted son (really his nephew) Ger-
manicus. Livia seems to have been a regular JezebeL-quando-
