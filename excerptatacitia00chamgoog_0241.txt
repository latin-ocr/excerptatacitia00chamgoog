Boon 111.] ANNALS. 189

journal of public transactions, preserved probably in the archives of
state. The author says he found nothing in these records about any
part (officio) which the mother of Germanicus took in the funeral
services ; while besides (super for praeter, Intr. 55) Agrippina, Drusus,
and Claudius, the names of his other relatives also were found there
(praescripti sint). —facilius credideriml, “ 1 could more easily
believe.'' A perfect subj. is often used thus to express a present
thought in a less positive way (like our potential mood), and with
greater vivacity, as though it were already past (see 4:32). —ut
par . . . videreturJ, “ that their grief might seem equal, and that,
by the example of the mother, the grandmother and uncle might
seem to be detained.'’ Videretur is to be supplied with maeror.

4. 'rumulo AugustiJ. In the Campus Martius, as is evident
from what follows. Torches (faces) were carried at funerals, even
in the daytime (Dic. Antiq.).—sine insignibusJ. “Id est, sine
toga, sine annuli8‚ sine lato clavo '³ (Doed).—condd.isse], “had
perished,'’ i.e. in the death of Germanicus. The infin. depends on
clamitabant. The promptness and openness of this cry showed a dis·
'regard of their present rulers (imperitantium), who would be likely
to be offended by it. — illil, “ to her.''

5. Ipsum . . . intravissel, i.e. Augustus in person met Tiberius
at Ticinum (Paria), returning from Germany with the body of Dru·
suS, and accompanied it to the city. —quanto]. Maqis is omitted
(see 1:68).—nisi . . . viaJ, “except in the journey of a single
day,’' i.e. from Tarracina to Rome (sec. 2). — propositam . . . effi-
giem], “a statue laid upon a bed,'’ i.e. representing the deceased.

6. Non enim . . . civitatibus], “for the same things are not
vbecoming (i.e. in the exhibition of grief, ὅσα), for princely men and
an imperial people, as for moderate families and states.'’ Principibus
and imperatori are used here as adjectives (see Intr. 46).—conve·
nisse . . . solatial, “that lamentation had ensued ‘upon the fresh
grief, and from mourning there had come reliefs.'' Notice the distinc-
tion between dolor, luctus, and maman—quia . . . suberatl. The
use of the indic. interrup ts the indirect discourse (Intr. 81).

This is the end of Germanicus, one of the most interesting char-
acters in Roman history. He died at the age of thirty-four, aa). 19.
