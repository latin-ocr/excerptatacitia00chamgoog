ducted through informers (delatores). What a solemn reprobation
upon this system is pronounced in these and the few following
words!

3. Nunc . . . animusl, i.e. at the time of the publication of this
tract, which, from what follows, must have been before the death of
the emperor Nerva (as he is not spoken of as divi), and after his
adoption of Trajan in Λα). 97 (who is here called Nerva Trajanus),
i.e. during the year Aa). 98.—nec spem . . . assumpseritl, “nor
has Public Security assumed hope and a wish merely, but the very
confidence and strength of the wish.’' The figure of the goddess of
Security upon the coins is here represented as assuming in her
countenance not only the expression of the hope of security for the
state, but the confidence of its actual realization.—qm‘ppe], “be-
cause indeed '’ = quia-pe.—per quindecim annosJ, i.e. from Ab.
81 to Aa). 96, the length of Domitian's reign, who immediately pre-
ceded Nerva.—nostri superstites sumusl. They had been vir-
tually dead during the constrained, death-like silence of so many
yearS, from which they had at length revived under the good prince
Nerva. During this period, however, as is implied in what follows,
he had collected the materials for his historical works. —ut sie dix-
eriml. For this use of the perf. subj. in subordinate sentences, see
Intr. 16.

4. Quae equestris nobilitas estl. See H. 1: 11, note. —per
omnem . . . cultuml, “ through the entire round of the liberal
arts.'’—ab illecebris peccantiuml, “from the enticements of
sinuers.'’—quod . . . habuitj. The indic. after quod gives an
actual reason derived from the nature of the case, and not merely
what is a reason to some individual from his particular view of the
case, which would-require the subj. (Μ. 357). Marseilles was
actually a safe place for the young, not merely that his parents
thought it so. It was an old Greek colony. —locum . . . compo-
situml, “ a place uniting- and combining, in happy proportione, Gre-
cian elegance and provincial frugality.”—ultra quam . . . sena-
toril. Philosophers do not usually make very good politicians. Not
only are philosophical studies so absorbing as to prevent a suitable
knowledge of things practical, but philosophical principles are not
limber enough for the supple arts of the politician. —quam cautel.
See Ann. l: 68.—Quod est . . . moduml, “what is the most
difficult, a just mean in philosophy.”

5. Diligenti . . . ducil, “a careful and considerate leader.’'
