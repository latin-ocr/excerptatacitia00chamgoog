of this legion accompanied Valens, but only detachments (electi)
from the other legions. The cohorts and wings were auxiliary infan-

is a summing up of the whole number of his forces just described, ad ’
being merely an adverb, and the gender of daea being determined by
milia—tota mole bellu, “ with the whole weight of the war‚'' i.e.
with all the remaining forces. The force under his immediate com·

little used by the earlier writers, and it will be observed that a larger
proportion of his words are those from which the corresponding
words in modern languages are derived, indicating, perhaps, a grad-

interest to his narrative (see Ann. 1:28).

1. struebat . . . exitio fuitl. Titus, the son of Vespasian,
now sets out for Rome to salute Galba on his accession to the princi-
pate, and the author sees in this, among other eventS, an indication
(see 1 : 10) that fortune was moving to bring his favorite hero, Ves-
pasian, to the throne. The sentence is characteristic of the author,
and presents a fine specimen of that solemn grandeur which per-
vade· his writings; personifying fortune and representing her as
