r ξ 55. Super is used by Tacitus.
, (α) Instead of praeter.- super virtutem3 super insitam violentiam3
and thus often, as, also, in Livy.

(b) Instead of de.- super re scribere, consultare, credere. This
usage, very rare in the strictly classical writers, is entirely wanting in
Caesar, but common in the later writers.

5 56. Ex imTacitus is used to express the origin, the cause, the
immediate succession in time, the manner of an action: as, ex re con·
sulere; ex modo alicujus rei; and finally he uses it with neuter ad-

jectives instead of adverbs z as, ex facili (easily), ex aequo, ex affluenti,
after the Greek.

ξ 57. Erqa is sometimes used for adversus (“ against,'' “ towards‚''
in an unfriendly sense): as, sinistra erga eminentes interpretatio;

fastus erga patrias epulas; discordia erga Germanicum. So, als0, in
Nepos: odium erga aliquem.

ἓ 58. Juxta.- velocitas juxta formidinem (kindred to sear) 3 populi
imperium juxta libertatem (Ann. ὃς 42). In this sense only in
Tacitus.

ᾗ 59. He sometimes uses the rare prepositions .· adusque, abusque,
simul, but only in the Annals.

ἦ.. 5 60. The interckanqe of prepositions with each other, or of prepo-
sitions and cases as a substitute: as, ad-in, ob-pro, in-apud, in-ad-
νει-ωε, inter-apud, per-in ; adversus, apud, ad, in or inter, are
exchanged with the dative; per, ob, and ex, with the ablative.
Passages with these exchanges are found only in the History and
Annals. We find them occasionally in Livy, very rarely in strictly

classical writers. In Tacitus they are very common. For the ana,-
strophe of prepositions, see ἓ 115.
