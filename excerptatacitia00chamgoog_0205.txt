ANNALS‚ BOOK Ι.

ΙΝΤΒουσοΊ-οιιῑ No‘rn. — Annals are a brief history by years.
There is little anticipation or retrospection in annals; while in history
the past, the present, and the future are all blended into a single picture
to represent a period. At the beginning of each new year in the
Annals, Tacitus names the consuIS, and then relates the ware„ the
foreign proceedings, the acts of the Senate and of the Emperor dur·
ing the year. In his History‚ t00, he names the consuIS, but min·
gles with present events anticipations of the future—as in regard
to the approaching accession and glory of the Flavian Dynasty —and
illustrations from the past. From this it follows that history is a
more elaborate and artistic work than annals‚ which holds true of
the History and Annals of Tacitus3 though in places the style is more
highly wrought and artificial in the Annals than in the History. There
were originally sixteen books of the AnnaIS‚ giving the history of the
downfall of the Julian Dynasty‚ through TiberiuS, Caius (Caligula),
Claudius, and Nero. Of these books, the first six, containing the
history of the reign of Tiberius, are entire, with the exception of the
fifth. Then follows a gap to the eleventh book; and after this most
of the books are quite incomplete, large parts of some of them having
been lost. The Annals seem to hav‘e been published about As). 116,
the latest of his works. ,
