5 101. Ne with brachylogy: H. 2: 23, diffisus paucitati cohortium,
ne longius obsidium —parum tolerarent, where veritus is tobe supplied
in the final sentence, being omitted as if implied in diffisus. Ann.
11: 15, sed benignitati, etc. ; 12: 47, visui tamen, etc. A usage not
found elsewhere.

G. Conmrrotun Samnucns.

§ 102. Si, nisi (ni), seu (sive) with the subjunctive of repetition:
si mali forent (H. 1: 49); si quando assideret (Ann. 2: 57); si quando
disceptaret (Ann. 4: 7 ); nisi lacesseretur (ὃς 11); seu loqueretur seu
taceret (4: 60). Such sentences are very rare in Livy and writers of
the classical period, but very common in Suetonius and the later
writers.

§ 103. I udicative instead qftke subjunctive in the principa! sentence.

(1) The impevfict indic. in such cases expresses :

(α) The reality of an action or state ; as, ferrum parabant, ni miles—
minas interjecisset (Ann. 1: 23). Thus often with parare and espe-
cially in the Annals. In such cases, the principal sentence generally
precedes the subordinate sentence; in other8‚ it follows it.

(b) The duty or possibility of performing the action: si te—adopta-
rem, et mihi egregium erat, etc. (H. 1: 16, 5: 26); si—aspernaretur,
tamen mirum et indignum erat (Ann. 1: 42). The subordinate sen·
tence stands aster the principal sentence only once, Anu. 4: 19.

(2) The plupersect indicative indicates the continuance of the action
or state up to some past time designated in the conditional clause:
Agr. 37 ς H. 3: 27 ς Ann. 4: 9, impleverat, 6: 93 contremuerat,
43: 15, 50.

Both these tenses are found thus in strictly classical writers, but
not in Caesar. ⁹

ξ 104. The conditional sentence often depends upon a future par·
ticiple: rapturi imperium, ni ducantur (H. 3: 19); 4: 39; si omittere·
tur—invasurus (Anu. 1: 36), 1: 45, 2: 17. So in Livy and the later
writers, but not in Nepos or the strictly classical writers.

6 105. Nedum with a positive principal sentence: cuicunque nedum
