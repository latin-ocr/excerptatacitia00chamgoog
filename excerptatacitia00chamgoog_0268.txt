45. Castrorum], i.e. of the Othonians. They had returned to
their camp at the fourth mile from Bedriacum, and the Vitellians
had followed, and encamped within a mile of them. —munimentum
. . . victoriaJ, i.e. they were not intrenched.—patuit valluml,
‘⁴ the camp was thrown open,'' i.e. in order to receive the Vitellians.
—mali], “of evil,'’ “of loss.''—ceterum vulgusJ, “the remain-
ing vulgar ''=ceteri vulqus. It was some honor to be buried, but
more, as we see from the case of Orfidius, to be burned.

66. Victarum legionumJ, i.e. the legions of Otho, which had been
conquered at Bedriacum by the forces of Vitellius. Vitellius had
heard of this victory at Lyons, from which place he was now on his
way to the scene of the battle on the Po.—praecipua . . . ferocia),
“the ferocity of the members of the fourteenth legion being conspic-
uous.'’ They contended that only detachments of their legion (vest-
illariis) were present in the flght at Bedriacum. From the account in
sec. 43, it seems that they had been unexpectedly surrounded by a
larger number.-una tenderel, “should have quarters together,”
i.e. by themselves. For this meaning of tendere, see 1: 31. These
cohorts were originally auxiliaries of the fourteenth legion, from
which they had separated on account of a grave difficulty (1: 59;
2 : 27). —Augustae Taurinoruml, i.e. at Turin. -— sui cuique com-
militonesl, “their own soldiers to each,'' i.e. the soldiers of the
cohorts, and the soldiers of the legions. To prevent further difficul-
ties between them, Vitellius took the cohorts with him in his advance
down the Po towards Bedriacum, and sent the legion to Britain by
the Graian Alps, so as to avoid Vienne (near Lyons), which was hos-
tile to his cause (see 1: 65). —ferebantL “ were bearing,’' i.e. were
for proceeding with their standai-ds to Vienne.

67. Separatil. The members of the cohorts were divided into
small companies; hence the masculine. This was done to make
them less formidable3 but they were soon honorably dismissed alto-
gether from the service (honestae missionis). The pretorians had
constituted the most formidable part of the forces of Otho (1 ε 87).-
arma . . . deferebantl, i.e. they continued gradually (imperf.) to
accept their discharge, and deliver up their arms to the proper
officers. — spectaculum ederel, see Ann. 1 :22, note.

70. Indel, “ thence,’' i.e. from Ticinum (now Pavia), where he
had halted on his march to join his army. Having moved slowly
down from Germany in the rear of Caecina and Valens, Vitellius
had not arrived when the decisivo battle of Bedriacum was taught.
