PREFAGE. vii

by the labors of those who have preceded me. Of
the ‘older commentators, Doederlein and Orelli, and
’ of the more recent, Draeger and Heraeus, have been
constantly before me 3 while the excellent editions of
Professor Tyler have long been familiar to me by
frequent use in the class-room. As, however, I have
desired to have my pages as little encumbered as
possible with what is not absolutely required, I have
not generally thought it best to transfer to them the
learned references found in some of these editionS, as
I have not thought it necessary to give credit for
hints or matter derived from these sources, except
when adopted in form.

Tacitus,* the friend and companion of the younger
Pliny, was an eminent citizen of Rome under the
Empire, passing through the entire round of honora-
ble officeS, from the questorship to the conSulship 3
and yet comparatively little is known of his life and
personal history. Neither his descent‚ nor the time
or place of his birth, nor of his death, is known3
though it is clear that he must have been born about
the year A.D. 54, and died about the year A.D. 120,
after the death of the emperor Trajan, whom he
seems to have survived. He thus lived two or three
generations after the extinction of the Republic, and
hence after the golden age of the Latin literature3

θ Recent investigatione, show his name to have been P. Cornelius
Tacitus, instead of C. Cornelius Tacitae, as it has generally been
supposed to be. “
