84. mul. Historical infin. —1n verba ejus afflgitl, “brings to
his words,” i.e. to the oath οἱ allegiance to him. So: adactum in
verba ejus orientem (H. 2: 73). Proximos here refers to the higher
officere which were near him, and not away taking the census (81). -

et . . . ostendebantl. This was a silent, but most pathetic appeal
to his sympathy. What more touching! and how could a single
stroke better exhibit the crushing hardships of the Roman military
service! See also below, sec. 35.—sic . .- . responsuml, “it was
answered by them that thus (i.e. as they stood crowding around the
general) they would hear better.'’ They declined, therefore, to sepa·
rate themselves into maniples, and then Germanicus directs them
to display (praeferri) the flag of the maniples (three in each cohort),

lowing it depend upon orabant (which is usually accompanied by the
subj. without ut .- 2 ; 21 ; Intr. 78 ; H. 4933 A. and G. 196, Rem.). The

with the nouns (see Intr. 119, 12). -neque inopem requieml, “ nor
penniless rest,” i.e. to be discharged without any thing to support
them afterwards—vix credibile dictul. The wonder was, that
not only those remote from him and concealed by being huddled to·
gether, but some single individuals approaching near to him, should
tell him to strike.

61. Igitur cupido Caesarem, et0.1. Germanicus, having
crossed the Rhine *and pursued the Germans over the river Ems, to
the vicinity of the Teutobur-glan Forest, where Varus and his three
Roman legions were destroyed some six years before (see next sec.)
