of the Iliad of Homer, Books 1.-V1.‚ leaves so little room for fault-finding that we
shall not attempt any. Facing the titlepage is a beautiful fac-simile of a page of
the Codex Venetus A (13 x 10 inches), the most important MS. of the Iliad. The
introduction gives a very good summary of the results of investigations of modern
scholars as to the origin and mode of transmission of the Homeric Poenis ; and,
though necessarily brief, it will yet inform the student of what many quite recent
text-books of the Iliad do not, that there is such a thing as “the Homeric ques-
tion,’' and impart some idea of its nature and the different answers which have
been given to it. The sections 011 the structure and scansion of Homeric verse,
on the dialect of Homer, and the commentary generally, show a nice appreciation
of what a student needs and ought to have. Altogether the book is very handsome

and very scholarly, and we have no doubt will prove very useful. (October 18,
1883.)

Professor JAcoB Comum, Rutyers Colleye, New Brun-mich, N. J. —N o col-
lege edition of Homer has appeared, either in this or any other country, in the last

twenty years, that shows a superior knowledge of what as needed in the elass-
room.

Professor N. L. ANDREws, Madison University, Hammon, N. Y.—A more
satisfactory edition of the first six Books of the Iliad than this by Dr. Keep could

hardly be prepared. Every scholarly instructor and every good student will value
especially the introductory matter.

Professor Gitonem H. ern, Principal Preparatory Department, Oberlin
Colleye, Olaio. — Keep's Iliadis evidently superior to any edition now 111 use, and
we have voted to adopt it sor our classes. The introductory matter is valuable, and
includes asatisfactory outline of the Homeric forms 3 the notes are scholarly, grace-

ful, and suggestive3 and the whole work reveals the hand of the experienced and
enthusiastic teacher.

Professor B. PERRIN, Adelbert Colleqe, Cle-veland, Ollio. —I can clearly see that
it is by far the best in the field, and I shall at once recommend it for the preparatory
department, and use it myself. 1 am especially grateful for the chapter on scan-
ning, which could not be improved 3 also for the fac-simile of Venetus, and the
table of grammatical references3 but above all for the wealth of class—roem ex-

perience which has been incorporated ’111 the book. That cannot 110 supplied by
mere eruditiori.

Professor CnAs. F. Sm‘rn, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn. — I have
examined Keep's Iliad with the greatest care, and consider it by far the best Amer-
ican edition, and, indeed, one of the very best text-books we have.

Professor ALEXANDER Knmz, State University, Madison, Wis.-Keep’s Iliad
is incomparably the best edition which has appeared in this country.
