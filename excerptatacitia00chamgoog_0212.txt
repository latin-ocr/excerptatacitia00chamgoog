other places, it has an active meaning (knowing), as: gnarus sub
Nerone temporum (Agric. 6). Caesari here refers to Augustus .-
dubium . . . mortel. lmplies a suspicion that he may have been
put to death by Livia, on account of his privity to the supposed
purpose of Augustus to restore Agrippa Postumus to favor and to
the empire. . Such parenthetical clauses, with dubium, incertum, etc„
are quite common in Tacitus (Intr. 75). Augustus died aa). 14.
These first five sections are introductory, and how full of interest
and wisdom!

11. Versae . . . precesl. The senate, having paid proper
funeral honors to Augustus, now go through the farce of entreating
Tiberius to assume the duties of the government. — ab mol, i.e. by
Augustus. —sua modestia]‚ “his own moderate ability,'’ ‘⁴ humble
aspirations '’ (see H. 3 : 70). —subjectum fortunael, “ dependent

but not yet governed as provinces—tributa . . . vectigalia}
The former were direct taxes, the latter indirect taxes. — necessita·
tes ac largitionesL i.e. the necessary expenses of the government,
and gifts for the people and soldiers.—terminos imperiil. These
boundaries were the Euphrates, the Ister (or Danube), the Rhine,
and the Ocean. -- metu an per invidiaml, “ whether from fear or
through envy.” Notice the change from the abl. to per with acc.
for variety (Intr. 60).

15. Comifial, i.e. the election of magistrates, referring here espe-
cially to the election of pretore. These elections up to this time
(mn. 14) had been made by the people in the Campus Martius; now,
at the beginning of the reign of Tiberius, they were transferred to
the senate. But, as Draeger says, even while the elections were in
the Campus Martius, Augustus had the right ot nomination, which
virtuauy determined the choice. -7 studiis tribuum1, “ according to
