of the historical infinitives insuryere and trahere, and to be repeated in
the intermediate clause as the subject of pelleoeit5 the last clauses
being controlled by the causal cum (quum), followed as usual by the
subj. (Η. 517; A. & G. 180, e.) It will be observed here that con-
junctions a'nd forms of esse are sparingly expressed, which is usual
with Tacitus (Intr. 205 71). The Caesar here referred to was Caius
Octavianus Caesar, afterwards known as Augustus (the great). He
pursued ⁴and overcame Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of his
, uncle Julius Caesar, at Philippi (1³.c.42); then crushed out Sextus
Pompey (son of Pompey the great), in a sea-fight off Sicily (13.0. 36),
while he set aside Lepidus from the triumvirate (exuto), and finally
subdued Antony, the remaining triumvir, at Actium, which left him
sole ruler of the empire. As consul and tribune, he had the power
of assemblingrthe senate and the people and of the υετο, ant? grad-
ually assumed all governmental powers (munia senatus magistra·
tuum legum), retaining, however, the popular forms and designations
of public functionaries, as under the republic. By the distribution
of corn (annona) among the common people‚—either gratuitously

⁷ or at a small price,—and the other means here referred to, he

quieted the different classes at Rome ; while, as the author goes on
to say in the following sentence, the provinces ,gladly accepted, in
place of the factious government of the senate and people‚ that of a
single hand strong enough to quell the factious elements and enforce
the laws against their violence, intrigue‚ and bribery (vi, ambitu,
pecunia). It will be observed' that, strictly, eo maqe's is required before
opibns5 but it is often omitted by Tacitus (Intr. 97).

We have in this section an ,admirable statement of the conditions
favorable to the establishment of an absolute government. At the
same time, the ‘section is in striking contrast with the preceding
one, by the comprehensiveness, and indeed the complexity, of its
sentences; while there the statements are of the simplest and most
transparent character. .

3. subsidia dominationiJ, “as aids to his supremacy.’' The
dat. of advantage depending upon a noun is quite common in Taci-
tus (Intr. 32). The aids here referred to were Marcellus (son of his
sister Octavia), Agrippa, Tiberius, and Drusus. He promoted (ex-
tulit) Marcellus to this position by making him pontifex and curule
edile (i.e., superintendent of streetS, templeS‚ buildings, public works,
and games) ; Agrippa, by granting him the consulship for two succes·
sive years (geminatus), and afterwards making him his son-in-law 3
