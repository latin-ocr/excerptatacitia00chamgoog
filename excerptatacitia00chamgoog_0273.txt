reigned from his forty·sixth to his seventy-eighth year, is described
by cautissimam senectutem. Galba was of a noble family, and hence
possessed statues of his ancestors ; even these Vespasian had ab·
stained from (cessisti), i.e. he did not attempt to deprive even Galba
of the principate, though, like himself, not of the Julian family.
Fundatura, also firmatus, considerandus, absurdum, flaniacerat, and many
other words common in Tacitus, have more of a modern form and
sound than those generally used by earlier Latin authors (see 1 262,
note).—torpere . . . relinquerel. The subJ'ect of videtur.-—tuta
servitus essetJ. He was too eminent to continue to serve as a sub-
Ject3 he might meet from Vitellius the fate which Corbulo (an emi-
nent general who served in the east, see Ann. 15) met from Ner0,
who murdered him from fear of his eminence. —satis . . . time-
tur], “whoever is feared is sufficiently eminent in the eyes of a
prince who fears him.'’ One of the striking aphorisms of Tacitus. —
desiderabilem . . . feeitJ, i.e. Vitellius was so much more con-
temptible than Otho, that he had made the latter seem respectable.
-spargit . . . ministrat1. vitellius, fearing the factious influ-
ence among his soldiers of the forces which had adhered to the cause
of Otho, sent some of the legions away to distant provinces, and dis·
banded the pretorian cohorts (sec. 66, 67); thus, as is here said, sow-
ing, in the hostile feelings which they carried with them, new seeds
of wan—novem legiones-sl, four in Syria, three in J udea, and two
in Egypt (Heraeus).

77. Triumphale nomen]. Vespasian⁸ was granted the form
(nomen) of a triumph by the emperor Claudius for his brilliant mili·
tary services in Britain (see 3:44). At this time, no one but the
emperor could have a real triumph—capax imperiil. Titus was
twenty-seven years old at this time.—non cedere imperio eil,
“not to yield the government to him ’¹ (lit. “not to abstain from
the government for him ’'). Mucianus as an agent and ally of Ves-
pasian, and no rival, as he had just said, would certainly do this;
nay, as he goes on to say, would even adopt his son as successor,
were he emperor himself.— victil, i.e. the forces of Otho which had
been conquered by the forces of Vitellius, and which, therefore, “
would naturally be on the side of Vespasian. Hence they are re·
ferred to in the next sentence by hos, as being nearer the speaker in
thought and interest, though named first. —aperiet . . . ipsuml. ‘
War, like a heavy strain on the human system, discloses the weak·

nesses of a party. This is almost the exact counterpart of a pas·
