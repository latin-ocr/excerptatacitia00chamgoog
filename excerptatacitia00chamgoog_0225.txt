affects the greatest brevity, uses the dat. more frequently than most
Latin writers, to express an end or advantage, as: locum foederi ac-
cepit (Anu. 12: 46); so especially with obtentui, venatui, ostentui, and
other nouns of the fourth declension (see Intr. 31).— pervicacial, i.e.
of Mesua—multa dicendi arteJ, ‘⁴ a man of great art in speaking ’'
(see Intr. 38).—tam noval, “ so new, unusual things.”-seque
coraml, “ and in their own presence,” i.e. for themselves, on the spot.
Coram, as well as other prepositions, is often placed thus after its
noun by Tacitus, by what is called anastrophe (Intr. 117). — ab aede·
cim. annisL “after sixteen years’ service.”—orator publicae
camel, “ having become the advocate of the cause of the soldiers.”
—provenissentJ = prospere successissent (Draeger).

20. Nauportum} A town in upper Pannonia. It was a free
town, enjoying the rights of Roman citizenship (municipium).—
Vexilla convelluntl. As these were detachments of soldier-s
(manipuli) sent out for a particular service (to repair bridges, &c.);
the vexillum was their proper standard. For the order of the clauses
in this period, see Intr. 118.—retinentis]. Agrees with centuriones,
ending ·is for -es (‘·' the centurions restraining tlien1”).-praecipua

the carriage in which he was riding. —intentus . . . toleraveratl,
“ zealous of military works and labors, and on this account the more
rigid, because he had endured them himself! ” The old editions have
vetus here, instead of intentus.

and confining these disorderly soldiers. —ciere]. Historical infinl
With nomina it means “to call,'’ but with the other accusatives it
means “to incite‚'' “appeal to.’' By what is called zeugma, Tacitus
often strains the meaning of a word thus, to save the use of several
(see Intr. 121). Notice‚ too, the omission of copulative conjunctions,
so common with him—nihil reliqui faciuntL “they make. nothing
of a remainder,'' “they leave nothing undone.'' Reliqui is a parti-

meaning of the following quo minuS, see Intr. 99.—invidiam]. The
prevalent meaning of this word is “odiun1,'' “liatred.”—deserto-
