’ 22. Mandatl, “ he commits t0,'' and he would have carried it on, had
they not, &a (see 1 ε 23).—nihil abnuendoL “by refusing nothing,'’ ’
i.e. by declining to submit to no conditionS, however onerous. ’

23. Aestate adulta], i.e. midsummer. The months of each
quarter of the year— spring, summer, autumn, and winter —had a
particular designation 3 the first month in each quarter being called
primus (or novus); the, second, adunus,- and the third, praecepa—in
austrum cessit]‚ “ yielded to the south wind,'·’ i.e. this at length pre-
vailed over all the others. —humidis terrisl, “ on account of the low
(moist) lands.'' This was especially so on the coast. Humidis is
a happy conjecture of Halm for tumidis. —saxis . . . infestasL
“rendered unsafe by projecting rocks and concealed shallows.''
Observe the two different constructione (abl. and acc. with per) to
express the same causal relation. This is characteristic of Tacitus,
who always aims at variety (see 1: 64).—manantes], “ flowing ”
“ flooded.” =

24. Et truculentia . . . GermaniaJ. Quanto affecta this clause‘
also (“by how much Germany excels in rigor of climate ”). In the
following member of the comparison, for the sake of variety, tantum
is used, instead of the usual tanto (see Intr. 97). The description of
this calamitous sea-voyage is quite as vivid as that of the land-

fundo} Agreeing with mari, to be supplied from mare which fol·
lows.—toleraverant], “had sustained‚” “kept alive.'’—terram].
For government‚ see Intr. 25,c.—eodem . . . oppeteretl, “might
seek (death) by the same sea.'' The verb has a pregnant meaning.
Germanicus considered himself the cause (reum) of the calamity,
and as deserving the same death as the others.—intentis vesti·
busl, “with spread garments,'' i.e. for sails. Military cloaks were
sometimes made to serve for sails (H. 5: 23).

59. Aegyptum1. In the acc„ as though it were the name of a
city (see Intr. 23).— cognoscendae antiquitatis1. A causal gen.
as in 1 ε 3; 3: 9, 27; 4: 2. —This account of the visit of Germani-
cus to Egypt is interesting, as showing that the same air of mystery
and hoary antiquity hung over its history then as now. The visit
was made on his way to the eastern command, which had just been
assigned him. —sine militeJ, i.e. without a military guard. —pedi·
bus . . . amictu1, i.e. with the Greek sandal and mantle‚ instead of
