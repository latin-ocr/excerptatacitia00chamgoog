Of the two classes of adjectives referred to above, those with a
transitive meaning were 'used with the gen. by authors in all ages of
the language3 but the second class, with a gen. in an abl. relation,
were used rarely before Tacitus, and sparingly after him.

ς 45. The qenitive of quality with brachilogy: obsidionem flagitii
ratus; pergere ad Treveros et externae fidei (scil. qentes); Lentulus

senectutis extremae (i.e. a mem of extreme old age), and thus often. ’

In like manner, a180, Caesar has in his Gallie War (ὃς 6); quod eum
magni animi, magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis (scil. virum) cogno·
verat. We find the same usage also in Livy, NepOS‚ and the later
historieal writers.

Hadria, sidus comes, promontorium Misenum (also Miseni), vetus

ἓ 47. The attribute expressed by a clause in appositiva .· as, manus
intentantes, eausam discordiae et initium armorum (Ann‚ 1: 27), and
the like often. This apposition‚ expressing the end or object of an
action, is found occasionally in Horace, and also in Sallust and Livy.
But, as a rule, in writers of the classical period a relative sentence is
used in such cases, or a simple appositional noun governed by the
verb in the principal sentence.

also, in Livy, but especially in the later writers.
