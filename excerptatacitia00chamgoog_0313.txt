These few gems of thought collected from the pages of Tacitus
are designed to be committed to memory. For this they are admira-
bly fitted by their brevity‚ their depth of meaning, and wide appli· “
cability. Being apt and profound reflectione on the various affairs⁴
of life, as presented in the shifting scenes of history, the mind can
be equipped with no better or more useful furniture. As history
repeats itself‚ and there is a constant recurrence of the same or the
similar in the experience of life, occasions will not be wanting' for
their apt and effective use. At the same time, the condensed vigor
of their style, the solemn grandeur of their tone, and the native dig-
nity of the Latin tongue, are sure to give weight and authority to
them wherever appropriately introduced. Let the teacher, then,
call the attention of his pupils to these striking maxims, and explain
to them the circumstances of their original use and the applicatione
of which they are susceptible, and let the pupil con them till they
become as familiar as household words; he may be sure that he will

find his account in it in after life.
