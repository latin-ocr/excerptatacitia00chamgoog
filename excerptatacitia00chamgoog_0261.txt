arranging for his hero, in remote parts of the empire and with
unseen hands, the initial movements and causes which were ulti-
mately to lead to his accession to the government. The style, also,
in its pregnant condensation, is characteristic of its author. The
reigns of Vespasian and Titus were grateful (laetum) to the state,
that of Domitian oppressive (atrox) ; while the reign of Vespasian
was prosperous to him to the end, those of Titus and Domitian were
cut short by violence (exitio). All this, in the Latin, is expressed,
or rather implied, in ten words. As is so often the case in Tacitus,
the idea, though not fully expressed by the words employed, is suffi-
ciently implied to excite the mind to fill it out, and thus keep it con·
stantly on the alera—ferebat! (for praeferebat), “he presented,”
“offered’' This use of the simple for the compound form of a
word, is very common in Tacitus. In this he imitates the poets, and
at the same time abbreviates his discourse (Intr. 13). —principis1‚

quite common in such cases (Η. 423, 2, 3; Μ. 296, obs. 2.). Achaiae

i.e. whether he should proceed on his journey to Rome, or return to
Judea. The reasons on each side are given in the sentences which
immediately follow; where, it will be observed that sive (Vitello
sive Othoni) is used for aut (Intr. 68).

2. spes vicit1, i.e. the hope or belief that, should he return to
Judea' without proceeding to Rome, he would be safe from harm,
through the influence of his father, who would either join the victo-
