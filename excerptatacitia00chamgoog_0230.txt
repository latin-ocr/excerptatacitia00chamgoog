34. mul. Historical infin. -in verba ejus adigitl, “brings to
his words,” i.e. to the oath of allegiance to him. So: adactum in
verba ejus orientem (Η. 2: 73). Proximos here refers to the higher
officers which were near him, and not away taking the census (81). —

auditol, i.e. in Belgio Gaul, where he was engaged taking the census.
obvias . . . habuitl, “he met them without the camp.’'—audifi

coeperel. For the act. of coepere with a pass. infin„ see Intr. 14. —
et . . . ostendebantl. This was a silent, but most pathetic appeal
to his sympathy. What more touching! and how could a single
stroke better exhibit the crushing hardships of the Roman military
service! See also below, sec. 35. —sic . a . responsuml, “it was
answered by them that thus (i.e. as they stood crowding around the
general) they would hear better.’' They declined, therefore, to sepa-
rate themselves into maniples, and then Germanicus directs them
to display (praeferri) the flag os the maniples (three in each cohort),
that at least the cohorts might be distinguished by this. Praeferri
depends upon jubet, to be supplied from the previous sentence.

35. Exprobrantl, “ they exhibit ·as a reproach.'' —- propriis
nominibusl, “in express terms,'' i.e. they complained in particular
of having to make the rampart, the trenches, and to collect food,
camp materiale, fite-wood, and attend to other harassing duties
(such as making roads, bridges, δια), in time of peace. The author
sets forth their grievances in a tone of sympathy and pathos, as
though they were his own. —mederetur fessis . . . neu morteuil,
“that he should extend relies to them, exhausted as they were, not
death,'’ Suc. Both the subjunctive sentence and the accusatives fol·
lowing it depend upon orabant (which is usually accompanied by the
subj. without ut.- 2: 21 ; Intr. 78; H. 4933 A. and G. 196, Rem.). The
subjunctive sentence, it will be observed, is thus made co-ordinate
with the nouns (see Intr. 119, 12). —neque inopem requiemJ, “ nor
penniless rest,'' i.e. to be discharged without any thing to support
them afterwards—vix credibile dictul. The wonder was, that
not only those remote from him and concealed by being huddled to-
gether, but some single individuals approaching near to him, should
tell him to strike.

61. Igitur cupido Caesarem, ⁶¹³0·l· Germanicus, having
crossed the Rhine ¹and pursued the Germans over the river Ems, to
the vicinity of the Teutoburgian Forest, where Varus and his three
Roman legions were destroyed some six years before (see next sec.)
by the German general Arminius, now proceeds to survey the scene
