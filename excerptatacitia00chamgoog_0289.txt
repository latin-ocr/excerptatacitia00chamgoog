to (moderated) the Bedriacan victory ’' (see 2: 45). In this sense,
tempero takes a dat—etiam perfidiaml, “even his treason.’' His
treason had been serviceable to them; but as a moral wrong they
could not but condemn it. Tacitus rarely overlooks the moral
aspects of actions.

32. In neutrum], i.e. neither in favor of its preservation nor of
its destruction—Othonis quoque bellol. To have assisted the Vi-
tellians against Otho was an additional offence‚ as most of their present
forces had supported Otho in that conflict. —illuserantL “ had
mocked‚'’ “insulted.’' The thirteenth legion had belonged to the
army of Otho in his conflict with Vitellius, and had been lest at Cre-
mona to superintend the building of an amphitheatre in which Cae·
cina was to exhibit a gladiatorial show (2 : 67). The author is giving ,
their various pretexts or motives for proceeding to sack the city. —
invidiaml, “animosity‚” “ hatred towards them.'’ — mercat-uel,
“ os the fair.” — ceteri duces in obscurol, i.e. as to what they did
towards bringing on the sacking of the city. —statim . . . incales-
cerentJ, “that it would soon come to pass that they would be hot
enough.” This reported saying of his (excepta vox) seemed to im·
ply that he intended to sack and burn the city3 and being in this low
slang style, it is called a slave-like speech (vernile dictum).

The section containing the account of the actual sacking and ‚

burning os the city I omit, as being too horrible to read with any
pleasure, notwithstanding the consummate art and power of the nar·
rator. Indeed, the preceding account of the progress of Antony,
with his handful of men, from Pannonia to the Po, closing with a
continuous ssight of two days and the intervening night, in which
the principal army of Vitellius, after several preliminary battles‚
was cooped up in its camp at Crem-ona, and the camp, city, and army
all taken by assault, may be said to border upon the frightful. And
yet the events are related with such skill and power, with such
moral earnestness and sympathy for the right, as right is considered
in war, as to keep up the interest unabated to the end, and produce
no revulsion of feeling.

34. Primordio suil, “from its origin.” The personal for the
possessive pronoun (Intr. 42).—Cornelio], i.e. Cornelius Scipio
(see Liv. 21 :6). It was at this time that it was established as a
Roman colony, as a defence against Hannibal, who was then invad-
ing Italy. It was near the junction of the Po and the Adda. -et si
