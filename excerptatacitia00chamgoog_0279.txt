Vitellius were not fulL— quanquam rebus adversis). Abl. ab·
solute instead of a regular concessive sentence (see 2: 73). For the
success οἱ the cavalry here referred to, see 2 z 41.—pulsu, sonitu-
que et nubel, “ by the clash and ·tramp, and clouds of dust.'’ A
speech in perfect keeping with the forceful and sels-confident char·
acter of the speaker.

3. Flagrans eculin, truci voce), “with flaming eyes and a
shrill voice.'’ But for the sake of variety flaqrans governs oculis as
abl. of specification, instead of agreeing with it as truci does with voce
(Η. 429). By such changes in construction, which abound in Taci-
tus. much greater variety is attained (Intr. 119).—Vulgu.s . . .
ferrentl, “that the common soldiers and the others might extol him
as the one man,” etc. The ut of the preceding sentence affects this
also and determines the mood of the verb. —ea statim concione

his post was, that the rising party might enjoy the prestige of hav-

6. vexillariosl, “i.e. electos e cohortibus auxiliaribus '’ (He-
