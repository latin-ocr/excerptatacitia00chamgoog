arranges them for battle. —agresti fossal, “by a country ditch ''
(see 2: 41). —apertum limiteml. Opposed to aqresti fossa and den-
sus arbustis. Apparently, a cleared way across the flelds from the
Postumian way—aquilarum signorumque} The former was
the standard of the legion, the latter that of the cohort (see 1: 44). —
praetorianum vexilluml. The pretorians who had been disbanded
by Vitellius (22 67) had resumed service in the army of Vespasian ;
at least a portion of them (vexillum).—in oomubusl, i.e. the right
and left extremities of the wings ; which was the usual place for the
auxiliary troops.—equite], “by the horse,'' “cavalry.’' An abl. of
the instrument, as it was conceived to be.—- Sido atque Italicus1.
Called kings of the Suevi, in sec. 5.

22. Ratio fuitl, i.e. reason dictated that the Vitellian forces
should have rested till the next day before making the attack. They
would have been in a better condition, and the Flavians, from want
of protection and supplies, in a worse condition. On the contrary,
they made the attack about nine o’clock in the, evening. The Romans
reckoned twelve hours for the day and twelve for the night, from sun
to sun: hence their hours differed in length at different times in the
year. It will be recollected that Caecina had deserted, and that
Valens had not yet arrived (see 15).——ord.inem . . . tenebras1, .

general.—primipili σωκῶ-10]. Captain of the first century of the
legion, the same as primus centurionum, primipilus or primipilaris,
though the last seems to have been the designation of such centurions
after retii-ing from service (see 70). He was the chief captain, and
had charge of the eagle of the legion. The vigor of the narrative
here is in keeping with that of the action described.

23. Dispersa primo . . . illisaL ‘¹ having been scattered at first·
and striking the bushes (see 21) without harm to the enemy ” (i.e.
Antony's army).—magnitud.ine eximia1, “ of extraordinary size.'’
An abl. of quality (H. 428; A. and G. 141, 7).—ignorati], “un-
known,’' i.e. on account of their disguise in the enemy's shields. —
vincla . . . tormentol, “the ropes and springs of the engine.'’
The engine here referred to was the ballista just named; an engine
which is described as acting something like a boW, with string and
