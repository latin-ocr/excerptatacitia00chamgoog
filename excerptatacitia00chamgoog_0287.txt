Moenia are not simply the walls of a city (muri), but the walls as fur-
nished with defenceS, such as turretS, formidable gateS, διο. (see
sec. 30). The fortifications here referred to were made by the
Vitellians in the previous struggle with the forces of otha—for-
midolosuml, “dangerouS.''—quae super . . . milesl, “besides

librabanturl, i.e. the rocks and arrows (here called tela) were hurled
down from the turrets and other defences upon the Flavians ; hence
they suffered the more—proxima Bedriacensi viaeJ, i.e. the
parts of the rampart next to the way leading to Bedriacum (i.e. the
Postumian way) were assigned to the legions here named—ligones,
dolabras, falces, scalasJ, “grub-hoes‚'' “pickaxes‚'' “hookS‚''

gesture or nod, probably) as a prize to be taken and sacked. This
wicked device (ingenium) to stimulate the soldiers, the historian
Messala (who was present at the siege, sec. 9, 18) charged upon
Hormus (a freedman of Vespasium, sec. 12), but the elder Pliny upon
Antony himself (see next sec).

their former fame or life by this however basest (i.e. inconceivably

forms of the dying, and every image of death.” A fitting close to
the description of the general features of this assault on the outer
workS‚ which is continued more in detail in the following section.
Commentators point out the similarity in the sentiment and language
here to Thuc. 3: 81, and Virg. Aen. 2: 369.
