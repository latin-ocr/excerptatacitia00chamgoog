(c) When a verb of like meaning to that omitted precedes or
follows; as, Ann. 1: 28, 393 2· 5.
(d) When the thoughts of some one named ιιι what precedes are
given in indirect discourse‚ as in Ann. 1: 38; 12: 5. Tacitus goes
much farther here than his predecessors.

ξ 22. Verbs of movinq and actiny are omitted: Ann. 4: 57, tandem
Caesar in Campaniam (scil. profectus) 3 14: 8, quod nemo a filio (ve-
niret); 4: 38, melius Augustum (egisse) 3 1: 43, melius et amantius
ille (egit); 4: 12, atque haec callidis criminatoribus ; 6: 10, haec apud

contectus humeros ferina pelle (22 13) ; oblitus faciem suo cruore
(2 : 17 ) 3 nudae brachia ac lacertos (G. 17) ; and in many other cases.
