mm os· AGRIOOLA. 249

pian Hills in Scotland. —pugnae prioris], i.e. in the southern part
of Scotland during the previous summer, in which the Britons were
badly beaten (sec. 25 and 26). —cruda et viridis senectusl, “a
hale and green old age.'' The same expression is found in Virgil
(Aen. 5: 304). Senectus here has the meaning of senecta. —sua quis-
que decoral. Either badges of nobility or of distinguished valor,
or trophies won from enemieS.

30. Universi1, i.e. we all, nos being understood. Scotland was
not yet subdued.—praelium atque annal. A rhetorical expan-
sion. Indeed, this is rather a rhetorical speech for a barbarian, —on
the whole, the best speech to be found in the works of Tacitus,—
eoque . . . sitil, “and on this account placed in the very sanctuary
of the island ; ” just as the penates and other sacred things were kept
in the sanctuary.—servientium litoral, i.e. such as those of the
Gauls, the Belgians, and Batavians, which could be seen from the
southern part of the island—recessus . . . famaeJ, “our very
retirement and concealment to fame.'' Famae is probably the dat.
for contra famam,- as, firmus adversis, “firm against adversities'’
(sec. 35).—atque omne ignotum, et0.]. Halm here follows the
suggestion of Brotier, and places this sentence immediately after de·
findit, instead of leaving it after patet. The thought is thus much
more coherent.—ambitiosi]‚ i.e. to rule over even the poor.

31. Bona . . . in frumentum]‚ “our goods and fortunes are
consumed in tribute, our land and annual crop in contributions of
grain.'' The reading here, too. differs somewhat from that of the
common editions—quotidie emit, quotidie pascit], i.e. by pay-
ing tribute, and by supplying the Roman armies with food. They
thus supported their masters instead of being supported by them, as

- ordinary slaves were—novi nos et viles], “we last (novi) and

cheap ;’' like the new-comers in a family of slaves. And as the
Romans had no mines, &c., for them to work, they were sought only'
for destruction.—Brigantes femina duce]. The reference here,
undoubtedly, is to the insurrection against Suetonius Paulinus under
Boadicea, the account of which is found in Ann. 14: 313 the Brigan-
tes probably joining the neighboring tribes in the insurrection. — in
libertatem . . . bellaturiL “ about to fight for liberty, not for sub-
mission‚'' i.e. with no purpose of submitting. The reading here also
is in dispute.

32: Nisi siJ. So also Ann. 15: 33. Like the Greek εἷ μὴ εἷ (Μ.
442, c,· A. and G. 176, a). Followed by the indic. (putatis) as ex-
