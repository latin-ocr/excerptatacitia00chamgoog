sification having superseded that by centuria (see Dic. Antiq. p. 1008).
- exsolutuSJ, “ freed from.’' In their more popular form, the elec·
tions had been attended by bribery and solicitations of various
kinds, from which the senate chamber was comparatively free ;
hence the people more readily acquiesced in the change. —mode-
ranteJ, “regulating‚'' “arranging‚’' “agreeing.’'—sine . . . desig·

nandosl, ‘⁴ to be elected without repulse and solicitation,” i.e. without Ι

opposition on the part of the senate, or further demands on his part.
The emperor thus had the absolute choice of four out of the twelve
pretors (the manner of whose election is here under discussion), and
the nomination, and hence virtually the election of the othei-⁸3 as he
did also of the consuls and the other public functionaries.—tri-
umphali vestaJ, i.e. the toqa picta (purple mixed with gold), such
as the consuls and pretors wore when they exhibited the games in
the Circus Maximus. This sentence, introduced by ut, serves as a
substitute for a noun corresponding to pecunia (see Intr. 119, 12).

accession of a new prince. Aul (“ or else ”) expresses an absolute dis·
junction between things which mutually exclude each other, so that
only one of them can be taken ; while vel (“or if you wish,” from
velle) presents an alternative between things which do not necessa·
rily exclude each other, and hence allow an option. — theatra-lium
operaruml, ‘⁴ of the theatrical factions,'’ i.e. factions devoted to sus-
taining certain actors by applause and hissing their rivals. They
often occasioned great disturbance at the theatres, and had to be
restrained by severe laws (see 77, and 9: 13).—et quaenam] soret
(in the subj. in an indirect question) is omitted here (Intr. 20).

17. Paucioribus tribunisl. There were sixty centurions and
six tribunes to a legion, which when full contained sixty centur-ies
(originally hundreds=6000), thirty maniples (of two hundred men
each), and ten cohorts (originally of six hundred men each). But
before the time of Marius, the term cohow-t was little used except of
auxiliary troops (and indeed is generally so used by Tacitus); and
the maniple consisted of only sixty soldiers, constituting a division in
each of the three lines of the legion (hastati, principes, triarii), which
