ctiam si in eodem monte sitam.'’—socordi custodial, “with a
careless guard.''—Domitianum fiands flliuml. Domitian, the
youngest son of Vespasian, was at Rome when his father was pro-
claimed emperor by his legions in the east, and, as we shall see, nar-
rowly escaped falling into the hands of the Vitellian forces. He was
saved on the present occasion by being smuggled into the citadel in
the slumbrous hours of night (concubia nocte) through the negli-
gence of the guard—per neglectal, “ through what had been
neglected,’' i.e. a complete investmeut of the citadel.—artas real,
“that their condition would be straitened.” Fore is to be supplied
here.

brother’s house appears to have been a conspicuous one, calculated
to attract the attention of the public (irritandis hominum oculis),
and hence his going there, rather than to his own house on the Aven-
tine, seemed too ambitious for one who considered himself a private
man. This brother's name was Lucius (theu at the head of the
Vitellian forces at Tarracina, 84), and was the emperor’s chief reli·

“not from the capitol even had it been abstained by him.'’ He was
then investing the capitol, in order to capture Sabinus and his forces.
