184 nome. , [Boou 11.

17. catervisl. This term is properly applied, as here, only to
bodies of barbarian troops. —imperatorem adverterel, “ attracted
the attention of the' commander.” The ending -ere in the third per-
son plural, perf. active, is more common in Tacitus than that in
-erunt. — manu, voce, vulnerel. A climactic asyndeton (Intr. 71, 2).
—irent]‚ ‘⁴ that they should advance.’'—illa], “ there,'’ “by that
way,’‘ via or parte being implied.—trad.iderunt], “related,’' “as-
serted'' —prorutae arboresl, “ the trees cut down,'' ·‘ prostrated.'’

18. Quinta . . . oppleverel, “the enemy slain from the fifth

honr of the day till night covered the distance of ten thousand paces
with their dead bodies and arms.'’—Tiberium . . . salutavitl.
Tiberim, as the reigning emperor, was considered as gaining all the
victories of his generals.
. 19. Haud perinde . . . quam1, “not in like manner as‚” i.e. this
trophy enraged them more than all their sufferings and losses.—
trans Albiml. They had been forced back from the Rhine, across
the Ems and the Weser, and had been preparing for another remove
across the Eme—plebes . . . senes} Adversative asyndeton in
pairs (see H. 1 ε 3).—arta intus . . . humida]‚ “ with a contracted
and moist plain within.'’

20. Consilia . . . occultaL “plans, places3 movements open or
concealed.J' Asyndeton again. Forlocos, instead of loca (see H. 2 : 42).
—objectum . . . enitereturl, “might gain possession of the op-
posing mound,'' i.e. the mound made by the Angrivarii.—quod
arduum nibil, “what was difficult he reserved for himself.'' The
meaning of permisit is applicable to this member of the sentence only
by a very forced zeugma.—-quis]. This contracted form seems to
have been used here for variety, as quibus had just preceded it. The
form, however, is very common in Tacitus. — ut si . . . succederentL
“as if they were approaching a wall.''—0011ato . . . certatuml,
“there they struggled‚ step against step,” i.e. they contested the
ground inch by inch (see Η. 2: 42).

21. Coactal, “ crowded together ; '' this agrees with ηιιιΙιίιιιᾱο, the
subject of the intervening verbs. These subjunctives, as is frequently
the case in Tacitus, are equivalent to posset with the infin. —foderet].
The same construction is continued here as in the preceding sen·
tences, depending upon cum (quum). —oapiti]‚ i.e. to the exposure of
his head, dat. of disadvantage.—nil opus sorel. This was a war
of extermination, and no quarter was to be given. The cool indif-

ference with which this is stated shows the savage spirit of the
times.
