ἫΒΒΟΤΤἙ. LATIN PROSF3. Latin-Prose through
5 English Idlom. Rules and Exerclses on Latm Prose Compo-
sition. By the Rev. Enwm A. Anno'rT, D.I)., llead
Master os the City of London School. With Additions by E. R.
Hournnmrs, A.M.‚ LL.D. 18m0‚ eloth, 205 pages. 90 ets.

The author’s object is to prepare students for the study‘and composition ol
Latin Prose, by calling their attention first to the peculiarities of English hlium, and
then to the methods of representing the English in the corresponding Latin idiom.
A good deal of space has been given to the Prepositions. The Exercises are pur-
posely unarranged, as connected examples are useless to test a pupil’s knowledge.

Abbott’s Latin Prose is the best book of the kind with which 1 am acquainted.
[t teaches the student to compose Latin, instead of translating stock sentences.—
Prqf. Geo. O. Holbrooke, Triuity Cadme, Ilm-eford.

Any book by the author of “English Lessons '’ and the “ Shaksperian Gram-
mar”1 should expect to be ood. This seems to me simplv admirable, and is quito
as valuable for the study of *nglish as for the study oi Latin. —Prqfi E. ll. Grtffin
Williams Collegae, Wiuiamstown.

1 feel sure the book will be widely used, as it deals with Latin Composition in
the only right way.—Prqf. C. L. Smitlz, [Iar-card Colleye.
