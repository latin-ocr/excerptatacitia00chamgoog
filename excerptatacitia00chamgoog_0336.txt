SELEOTIONS FROM LUCIAN.

With Introductions and Notes by Curium-:s R. wunsam, Α.Μ., Professor

of the Greek Language and Literature in Lake Forest University.
16mo. 340 pages. sle.

The general Introduction has been made long and full, from a belief
that the student's interest and enthusiasm in an author are quickened by
a knowledge of his personal and literary history, and by an acquaintance
with the conditions under which he wrote aud the purpose of his writingS.
The special Introductions to the several selections will, it is hoped, be found·
useful in stimulating the curiosity of the student and in putting him in
sympathy with the shrroundings and object of the piece. The Notes have
intentionally been made ample, as it is thought that Lucian'will be used
especially for rapid reading; and there are frequent references to the stand·
ard grammars. Attention is constantly called to peculiar Lucianic con·
structions and words, and to other later usages. Historical‚ archaeological,
philosophical, and mythological questions are succinctly discussed‚ with
references to the original authorities or to modern treatises.

His modern tone, his felicitous style, his strong common sense, and
his abounding humor make Lucian delightful reading3 and it is hoped
that this edition may help to make his writings more widely used in our
colleges than has hitherto been the case.

‘⁴ These Dialogues of Lucian are just the thing for rapid reading or for reading
at sight. Lucian is so alert, so keen, and witbal so modern in feeling and temper,
that the student is driven to read on and on, just to see how the witty debate will
end. 1 am glad to see that Professor Williams has furnished an edition which will
fully meet the demands of the class-room.'’ —Prqfi J. E. Goodrich, University ‘ff
Vermont.

“A convenient edition of Lucian has long been needed. The want has now
been met by Professor Williams's industry and scholarship‚ and I have no doubt that
the book will be duly appreciated. The editor has collected in his introduction all
that is most essential for the student to know respecting the author of the dialogues
and respecting the dialogues themselves ς while the notes show a most judicious
choice between the extremes of too great fulness and barrenness of illustration.
The typography and external appearance are unexceptionable.'’ — Prqf. Henry M.
Baird‚ University qs the city of N ew York.

“The book is very well edited‚ and admirably gotten up as are all of your
recent publications. It fills a gap, certainly, in the list of serviceable text-books,
and 1 hope to put it to a practical test before long.” —Prqfi B. Pei-rin, Western
Reserve Colleye, ΟΙιίο.
