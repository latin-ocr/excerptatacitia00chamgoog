Μ. Tulli Ciceronis Cato Maior de Senectute and Laelius de Amicitia·

Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. American Edition, revised by
Fssntcls W. KELsnY, Professor of Latin in Lake Forest University.
16mo. 279 pages. 8120. Either part separately‚ 75 cts.

The present volume was prepared with the design of presenting to
American students‚ in a form best adapted to their use, the results of
Mr. Reid’s thorough and accurate work. The Introductions have been
recast with some enlargement, and the analyses of the subject-matter
have been entirely remodelled. The Notes have been in some instances
reduced, in others amplified‚-especially by the addition of references to
the standard treatises on grammar, history, and philosophy. The aim
throughout has been not simply to give aid on difficult points, but to call
attention to the finer usages of the Latin, and to add also whatever ex·
planation seemed necessary to a clear understanding of the subject.

“It is certainly the best edition of these works of Cicero with which 1 am
acquainted. 1 have used the edition by Reid and consider it a work of high merit.
Professor Kelsey's revision seems to me to retain all the desirable features of the
original edition. while much has been added which is of especial value to the Ameri-

can student. The book is pleasing to the eye and evidently well made.‘' — Prqf.
J. Η. Clcamberh‘n, Mar-ietta Colleye‚ Olzt’o.

· “It is a'handsome piece of work in every respect, and will, Ι doubt not, meet
with a cor-dial reception. The text is far better than that of any other edition, and

the notes are very clear and scholarly. 1 know of nothing better for our use here.''
-Profi A. G. Ηορλείηε, Hamilto‘n Comme, New Y ork.

“The original works of Mr. Reid Ι have used with much pleasure, and Ι am
satisfied that this edition by Professor Kelsey will meet a real want. 1 shall recom-
mend the work to my class next term when we read Cicero.” — Pros. W. C. Poland,
Brown Universi!y‚ R. J.

 

‘⁶ The work is certainly very scholnrly‚ and Ι doubt if a better commentary on
it could be prepared.” — Prqf. Frank Smalley. Syracuse University, N ew Y ork.

‘⁶ 1 think it in every respect preferable to all hitherto published‚ and shall intro-
duce it as soon as practicable.'' —Prqf- R. W. Swan, Iowa Colleye, lowa.

“When we read Cicero, 1 shall certainly choose this edition in preference to
any I have seen.'’ —Prqfi W. J. Gom, Racine Colleye, Wisconsc'n.
