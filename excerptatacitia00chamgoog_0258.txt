40. Lugubri prospectul, “ on account of the sad sight,'' i.e. of
the aged emperor struggling through the surrounding crowd. Galba,
having heard of the proclamation os Otho as emperor at the preto·
rian camp, was making his way to the forum to rally the people in
his defence. The forum was surrounded with temples and basilicae,
the latter being buildings furnished with double colonnades‚ and
used both as courts of justice and places for exchange.—quale

. . . silentium estl, i.e. a painful restless silence—audito . . .
depulsil. Arsascidae was the dynastic name of all Parthian kingS,
whatsoever might be their individual names. There was a bitter
hostility between the Romans and Parthians, as is here implied‚
which had been engendered by numerous conflicts.—qu0 minus

. . . successitl. Kings never spate regicides, however much they
may have been gratified by the assassination. This would be en-
dangering their own life in turn.

49. Β prioribus servisl, i.e. one of his servants before his eleva·
tion to the principato. —lixas calonesquel, “marketmen and
baggage carriers;'' generally found together (see 2:87, note).—
repert-um . . . admixtum estl. Corpori is dat. of community
(“mingled with his body ”). Sepulture with the Romans was gen-
erally by cremation, bodies being burned and the ashes preserved in
an urn, which was deposited in a funeral vault (see Becker's Gallus,
p. 110; also the word fimus in Smith’s Dic. Antiq.)-emensus],
“having outmeasured‚’' i.e. outlived. ‘He was seventy-three years
old (tribus et septuaginta annis, “in three and seventy years;”
abl. of tinne how long), not uncommon in the later writers, M.. 235,
obs. 3). -publicae avarus]‚ “ niggardly of the public funds.'’ Not
a very common fault in rulers—sine reprehensione patiensl,
“ tolerant without fault.’' The preceding verb (incidisset) is in the
subj. with ubi, as the following forent is with si, expressing a repeated
action (Intr. 88). —metus temporuml, “the fearful nature of the
tirneS‚” i.e. the danger in making one's self eminent made slothful
inactivity appear wisdorn. Tacitus greatly excels in these brief
sketches of character. This of Galba is a perfect gem.

50. Superioris Germaniaej. The upper and lower Germany of
the Latin writers were both on the Gallie side of the Rhine, the for-
mer nearer its source and south of the latter, which was nearer its
mouth in the German Ocean. Vitellius was commander of the lower
army (which consisted of four legions), whose revolt had been kept
secret at Roma—duos . . . deterrimosl. Otho was notorious
