DIALOGUE ΟΝ ORATORY.

Inrnonncroar Nom. — It is now universally admitted by schol-
ars that this is a genuine dialogue of Tacitus. An allusion to a
particular phrase in it as his, by his friend, the younger Pliny, in
one of his letters to him, seems conclusive on this point. And, then,
the style does not differ more from that of his other works than
might be expected in a dialogue written in his youth, as it appears
to have been (probably about Am. 74 or 75), and on a subject of so
entirely different a nature. It is known, too, that Tacitus was him-
self no mean orator, and well versed in the literature of oratory.

The dialogue purports to be a discussion between certain literary
friends of his on the comparative merits of ancient and modern
oratory, which Tacitus had listened to in his youth. In the brief
extracts here presented, however, the peculiar features of a dialogue
do not appear.
